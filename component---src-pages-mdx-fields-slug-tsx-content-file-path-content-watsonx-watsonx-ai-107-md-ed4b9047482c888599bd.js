Human language is very complex, the human brain is capable of understanding when we use words that mean the same thing or understand that certain words belong to a specific group. For example, our brains are able to understand that ",o.createElement(t.em,null,'"red"')," and ",o.createElement(t.em,null,'"blue"')," are both colors despite them being different words, we can also understand that when someone uses the words ",o.createElement(t.em,null,'"happy"')," and ",o.createElement(t.em,null,'"joyful"')," they generally represent the same emotion or feeling depsite them being two very different words. Trying to explain that to a machine is very difficult, but LLM's try to mirror some of this complexity in their own way, through a complex understanding of numbers. In short, an LLM tries to understand human language in a format that makes sense to machines, groups of numbers. Without getting to complicated LLM's use a translator to convert human language into numbers that it can easily associate with, this translator is usually an embedding function, and the output is a vector of numbers known as ",o.createElement(t.em,null,"embeddings"),". A simple example of this might be the the phrase ",o.createElement(t.em,null,'"Good morning"')," represented as the following ",o.createElement(t.em,null,"[34, 12, 234, 638, 12, ...]"),"."),"\n",o.createElement(t.p,null,"While to humans, this might not make any sense, it's meaningful to a machine because these numbers represent a sort of comprehesion for a machine to properly understand human language.

While both fo these techniques can be used to achieve the same thing, they differ in their approach. Watson Discovery is primarily used as a document understanding and analysis platform, this works out very well in scenarios where large numbers of documents are used or needed to make business decisions. For example, a large corporation sifting through larges amounts of company financial documents to determine insights before making a merger or acquisition; or a law firm sifting through briefings and other law documents to conduct legal research for legal precedents. Vector databases work a bit different by creating embeddings, or arrays of large numbers, from tokens of text which are then stored into a database and can be quickly referenced when a similar embedding query of user input is supplied to the vector database. Both solutions achieve the same results for determining context, however they way they are impletmented is their biggest differentiator. With Watson Discovery, you can make use of a managed service and sleek UI to ingest and even annotate documents for future Natural Language queries; given its managed nature Watson Discovery also proves to be an easier tool to integrate into other servies using a simple API Key, Service URL, and Project ID; however, this simplicity comes at the cost of granular control. Vector databases can used as both as a managed ",o.createElement(t.em,null,"(i.e. PineconeDB)")," or unmanaged ",o.createElement(t.em,null,"(i.e. ChromaDB)")," service, unlike Watson Discovery which is only provided as a managed offering. Vector databases also provide more fine tuned controls such as using different embedding models (for vectorization) or tokenizers allowing users to customize the DB to better fit their unique use-case which can be much better approach the general one-size fits all approach of Watson Discovery. This additional controls, does come with added complexity making it harder to easily integrate VectorDB the same way you can with Watson Discovery.
