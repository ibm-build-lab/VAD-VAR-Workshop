This dashboard is designed for demos on big or small screens, so feel free to use it on your laptop (so it's well suited for a Webex) or connect it to an external display. The dashboard is designed for use with or without views applied, but it is recommended to start with the <strong>All Data</strong> view.</p>\n<p>This lab's dashboard is designed to quickly showcase key FinOps concepts for an introductory demo. However, it's far from exhaustive in covering solution feature set. You are encouraged to explore more and enhance their demo over what is provided in this guide.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the Cloudability User interface and select the <strong>Multi Cloud FinOps Dashboard</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You start the demo at the Multi Cloud FinOps Dashboard as shown above. The first thing to note about the platform is that it brings single pane of glass cost visibility across the major cloud providers: AWS, Azure, and GCP.</p>\n<p>Clients can understand the cost of the entire cloud footprint in near real time and more importantly, measure it in a way that makes sense to the business.</p>\n<p>For example, you can surface what you have paid to the <strong>cloud vendors (1)</strong> versus what has been <strong>consumed (2)</strong>. The amortized cost metric will allocate upfront savings plans and reserved instance payments to where and when they were consumed. You can also choose to apply custom pricing rules or strip away discounts with metrics like these, basically representing cost.</p>\n<p>The insights delivered by Cloudability are primarily based on the detailed billing information available from each cloud vendor which are enriched to help you make sense of it. This enrichment categorizes the spend in some handy ways. One of the most interesting definitions available by default is <strong>usage family (3)</strong>.</p>\n<p>As you can see here in this daily spending chart, you can easily see what costs are going to areas like storage versus VM instances versus data transfer and so forth.</p>\n<p>Other popular reporting dimensions allow users to track the consumed cloud service, identify the type of a cost item, and identify the <strong>transaction type (4)</strong>.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Select <strong>Product:Turbonomic</strong> from the <strong>Current view</strong> dropdown in the top right corner.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You may have to scroll to the top of the window to see the dropdown.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What's incredibly powerful about Cloudability is that all this data is standardized through its view engine, whether you want to sort by application, by product, or by any other meaningful dimension for your business.</p>\n<p>Views can be defined based on any attribute of a cost record, either loaded directly from the cloud provider, such as tags, account id, labels, etc., or from business mappings that correlate these data into meaningful business dimensions (for example: product, owner, business unit, etc.).</p>\n<p>This allows users to focus on the data that is relevant to them. It also provides access control, so users can only see the cost data that they should see.</p>\n<p>If you log into the system as the product owner for specific product or application (in this example, you are logging in as the owner of Turbonomic product), you'll only see the data for that product.</p>\n<p>This level of data access extends across all the features and functions within Cloudability. Every user can self-service all the data across their organization. This is true whether they want to delve into specific anomalies that happened in the cloud platform or look into the containers that the cloud leverages. Data access is ensured all the way down through rightsizing and capabilities such as forecasting.</p>\n<p>Everything in the Cloudability platform is designed to help users self-service the cost data and make the right decision in the cloud in real time.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Select <strong>All Data</strong> from the <strong>Current view</strong> dropdown in the top right corner, then on the left-hand navigation pane, expand the <strong>Insights</strong> twisty.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The content of this menu depends on your assigned access level. The actual items listed may differ from the screenshots in this document, depending on your privileges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Look at the left-hand side of the navigation bar. Cloudability, at its core, was designed as a big data analytics engine for public cloud. This means, it is going to pull in every resource ID, cluster namespace, or label across your entire environment on a per second basis and keep that data in gratuity to support year-over-year, month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter style reporting.</p>\n<p>This data reporting capability is critical to support certain features like anomaly detection, forecasting capabilities, and general reporting and auditability of your cloud data, especially for large organizations. Clients who try to build such capabilities on their own quickly realize that storing, maintaining, and keeping data to support this granularity of reporting is typically an incredibly expensive exercise.</p>\n<p>On top of the core dashboarding and reporting capability that was just shown, Cloudability has a suite of features around each of the different FinOps phases.</p>\n<p>Cloudability Insights are directly related to the Inform phase of the FinOps cycle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>TrueCost Explorer (1)</strong> and <strong>Tag Explorer (2)</strong> help with the cost allocation.</li>\n<li>Container <strong>cost allocation (3)</strong> is found here too.</li>\n<li><strong>Savings Plan (4)</strong> and <strong>Reserved Instance (5)</strong> views provides tracking of these items.</li>\n<li><strong>Anomaly Detection (6)</strong> helps quickly detect unusual spend</li>\n<li><strong>Scorecards (7)</strong> help compare the efficiency of cloud usage across teams.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>On the left navigation pane, expand <strong>Optimize</strong> twisty.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The content of this menu depends on your assigned access level. The actual items listed may differ from the screenshots in this document, depending on your privileges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once you know who is spending what, you are likely to ask: <em>\"How can Cloudability help us spend less?\"</em></p>\n<p>Cloudability does that through helping plan <strong>Reserved Instance (RI)</strong> usage and commitment management across all the cloud providers as well as right-sizing and automatic ROI tracking for that optimization.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Expand the <strong>Plan</strong> twisty on the left navigation pane and select <strong>Current Month</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The content of this menu depends on your assigned access level. The actual items listed may differ from the screenshots in this document, depending on your privileges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once you know who is spending what and that you're spending the right amount, you will want to know: <em>\"What are we going to pay tomorrow?\"</em></p>\n<p>So here is the current month analysis and longer term forecast to show you what you might be spending 6, 12, 24 months out, all while tracking your budget and your plans to actuals while re-forecasting that data throughout the year. So, you're constantly up to date on what your teams are expected to spend.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Expand the <strong>Organize</strong> twisty on the left menu.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let's talk about <strong>Organize</strong> tab. Cloudability will ingest all your tags and labels across all the cloud providers. It can also adhere to any sort of account hierarchy, subscription, or project, anything like that. Typically, 99% of Cloudability clients leverage \"business mappings\" feature. This feature provides a much more robust rules-based allocation strategy that maps cloud spend back to your actual business priorities.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>Expand the <strong>Insights</strong> twisty on the left and select <strong>Tag Explorer</strong> option.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Remember that you are accessing a live demo environment. The actual content of your demo may differ from the screenshots in this document.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Tag Explorer lets you can quickly see the state of all your tagging across your business. This view helps achieve one of the principles of FinOps: <em>\"Everyone takes ownership for their cloud usage\"</em>. Looking at this chart you can quickly identify the cloud spend that is not allocated to the responsible party.<br>\nUsing this report, you can see a very limited amount of cloud spend that can be directly allocated to Owner, Environment, or Application by hovering cursor over the horizontal bars on the report associated with these dimensions on the left. This is very common for most Cloudability users when they start.</p>\n<p>There are some things you cannot tag using your cloud provider. For example, there's multi-tenancy…  In that case tagging doesn't really get you the data that you need for allocation. In this demo, not that 86% of data is not tagged by a Turbonomic owner, (there could be a lot of different reasons for that).<br>\nSome cloud vendors have an account-based approach where clients don't need to put a tag value on resources because the account, subscription or project tells them which application or owner the workload belongs to.<br>\nThere could also be infrastructure that is containerized, where how costs are allocated to an owner or application comes from a namespace or a label within the Kubernetes or OpenShift clusters.</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Click on the grey horizontal bar associated with the <strong>Owner</strong> or <strong>Team</strong> dimension.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note how the bottom part of the report displays list of cost items without tags.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Using Cloudability's Tag Explorer, you can quickly identify the resources that can be tagged but are not tagged. Cloudability helps you quickly identify the items that should be properly tagged by your Operations team, so the associated costs are allocated to the proper owner or application. For items that cannot be tagged, Cloudability provides the flexible Business mappings engine that lets you define logical conditions using any available attributes to assign the cost to the responsible party.</p>\n<p>This is very important, because if you can't allocate the cloud spend dollars accurately and successfully back to business units, application, or any cost centers, you won't be able to perform the optimization, forecasting or any of the other main value driving use cases supported by FinOps.</p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>From the left navigation menu, expand <strong>Insights</strong> and select <strong>Containers</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For shared environments like managed Kubernetes or OpenShift clusters, Cloudability provides a dedicated mechanism to collect usage metrics, such as CPU or memory consumption. These metrics are used to properly divide the costs of running the whole cluster to owners or initiators of the workload</p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>From the left navigation menu expand <strong>Insights</strong> and select <strong>Reservation Portfolio</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In this demo environment, not all types of reservations are available. Pick the one that shows some values (most likely it will be AWS EC2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This view supports the <strong>Inform</strong> phase of the FinOps cycle by helping users quickly review the level of utilization of already applied cost savings measures, such as <strong>Reserved Instances (RI)</strong> or <strong>Savings</strong> plans. One of the main FinOps principles requires that cost savings are managed centrally by the FinOps team to achieve economy of scale. This view helps any user understand how they are utilizing the existing savings arrangements across all cloud providers and different services.</p>\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li>From the left navigation menu expand <strong>Insights</strong> and select <strong>Anomaly Detection</strong>, then click <strong>Details</strong> button on any of the displayed lines on the right.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Anomaly detection is another useful function that facilitates the implementation of the Inform phase of FinOps. The goal here is simple: detect anomalous cloud spend as soon as possible and alert users, so they can verify and react. There are many situations where this can save you a lot of money. Let me give you a few examples.</p>\n<p>There was a client that tried to test out Amazon Macie  when it was first released. They started testing Friday around noon, and they left the office end-of0day at around 5:00 pm. By around 9 pm, they had spent about $240,000 on Amazon Macie scanning through every account looking for security vulnerabilities and things like that. Cloudability raised alert within several hours, client opened a ticket with AWS support and because they were able to catch this situation within a 24-hour period, they were able to get a credit back for that service.</p>\n<p>Another example is related to bitcoin mining. There are many clients who have received alerts from Cloudability that they have strange, expensive workloads being deployed in weird regions they didn't typically operate in. Thanks to Cloudability anomaly detection they were able to catch and identify who was spinning these up when they happened.</p>\n<p>Cloudability's anomaly detection feature is powerful and robust because it is fully automated and based on the standard deviation analysis on any cost item. Users do not have to define any thresholds or alert rules, they are notified on anomalous spend across any service of any connected cloud service provider.</p>\n<ol start=\"12\">\n<li>Expand the <strong>Optimize</strong> twisty on the left-hand menu and select <strong>Rightsizing</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Look at the Cloudability features that supports the Optimize phase of the FinOps cycle. Let's look at Rightsizing. This is one of several items available to help you optimize your cloud spend. Cloudability is looking at the utilization metrics of different cloud services and makes a recommendation if Cloudability thinks there is a lower cost and more suitable instance type available. This Cloudability feature is often used by clients in the low FinOps maturity level (Crawl phase) when they are still learning how to operate in cloud and want to apply these actions manually. For more mature clients who want to optimize at scale in an automated fashion, IBM has a more focused solution called IBM Turbonomic.</p>\n<ol start=\"13\">\n<li>Expand the <strong>Plan</strong> twisty in the left-side menu and select <strong>Forecast</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Finally, as your FinOps practices mature, you'll typically want to implement Operate practices. Cloudability supports you by providing cost forecasts based on collected data and projected trend. You can review these forecasts for any of your cloud services and save the forecast as budget. Later, when new billing data is imported the actual costs are automatically compared against budget and visualized on the reports. This helps you manage your cloud spend.</p>","location":"/en/apptio-cloudability/101#cloudability-overview","page":"101: Cloudability Overview"},"9":{"title":"Summary","text":"<p>Let's quickly recap what has been shown.

Here is a list of some key terminology to keep in mind when discussing Apptio Cloudability:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>FinOps</strong> – Cloud FinOps is an evolving cloud financial management discipline and cultural practice that enables organizations to get maximum business value by helping engineering, finance, and business teams to collaborate on data-driven spending decisions.</li>\n<li><strong>Rightsizing</strong> – is a form of optimization where measurements are taken over time to assess the periodic requirements of a workload running on the cloud, and to match it to a virtual resource which is sized to run it efficiently with a minimum of waste. It is important to measure actual workload demand in small increments rather than using average load figures to be sure that workloads requiring larger instances for peak demand are accommodated. Rightsizing can be used as a technique to save cost but must always involve technology oversight as well.</li>\n<li><strong>Savings Plan (SP)</strong> – Each cloud service provider (CSP) provides customers the ability to discount on demand rates for cloud services used in exchange for a commitment to use minimum level of resources for a specified term. Depending on the CSP and the cloud services used, this commitment may be based on an upfront payment for a certain number of resource units, time units, or monetary value; SPs come with various payment options and timeframes</li>\n<li><strong>Reserved Instance (RI)</strong> – a commitment to use a cloud resource (usually of a specific type, location, and size) for a certain period of time (usually 1 or 3 years) in exchange for a discounted rate.</li>\n</ul>","location":"/en/apptio-cloudability/ref100#key-terminology","page":"Ref 100: Key Terminology"},"11":{"title":"Apptio Targetprocess","text":"<p>These labs covers the main capabilities of the product: <strong>resource management</strong>, <strong>strategic planning</strong>, <strong>budgeting</strong>, and <strong>program management</strong>.</p>\n<p>As you work through each section and subsection, you will assume several roles.

It is centered on<br>\nadaptive planning, self-organization, and short delivery times. It’s flexible, fast,<br>\nand aims for continuous improvements in quality.</li>\n<li><strong>Lean</strong> – A set of management practices to improve efficiency and effectiveness by<br>\neliminating waste. The core principle of lean is to reduce and eliminate nonvalue-adding activities and waste.</li>\n<li><strong>Portfolio</strong> – A set of value streams that deliver a continuous flow of valuable<br>\nsolutions to customers within a common funding and governance model. A<br>\nportfolio contains all the work items such as: Portfolio Epics, Epics, Features,<br>\nUser Stories, and Bugs.</li>\n<li><strong>Initiative</strong> – High-level business investment or plan. Sits at the top of the work<br>\nitem hierarchy in Targetprocess, contains smaller work items such as Epics and<br>\nFeatures.</li>\n<li><strong>Strategic request</strong> – An idea for work, but not a work item. Business leaders review<br>\nand prioritize them. They are developed into Strategic Objectives and Initiatives.</li>\n<li><strong>Objectives &#x26; Key Results (OKRs)</strong> – A goal-setting framework. There are three<br>\nlevels to an OKR:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Company goal</strong> – The highest level in the OKR, sometimes referred to as an<br>\nUltimate Objective.</li>\n<li><strong>Strategic objective</strong> – The next level in the OKR. Statement of the overall<br>\nvision with measurable steps to a desired outcome.

The framework is a body<br>\nof knowledge that includes structured guidance on roles and responsibilities, how<br>\nto plan and manage the work, and values to uphold. It promotes alignment,<br>\ncollaboration, and delivery across many agile teams.</li>\n<li><strong>Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)</strong> – (pronounced “whiz-jiff”) A prioritization<br>\nmodel that estimates the relative cost of delay of each job in a backlog and<br>\nsequences them based on their economic value. A team calculates each<br>\ninitiative’s score as the cost of delay that is divided by the job’s size or duration.<br>\nThe team then prioritizes those items that receive the highest ratings.</li>\n<li><strong>Story point</strong> - Story points are a useful unit of measurement in agile, and an<br>\nimportant part of the user story mapping process.

Let’s open our App Connect Designer. |<br>\n| <strong>Action</strong> 1.2.1 Show the home page and click <strong>ace-designer-demo</strong> .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |</p>","location":"/en/cp4i/104#1-accessing-the-environment","page":"104: Low-code integration using AI"},"73":{"title":"2 - Creating the flow","text":"<p>| <strong>2.1</strong> <strong>Create flows for an API</strong>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |<br>\n| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |<br>\n| <strong>Narration</strong> Here we are in the designer tooling. This is where we can create all our API integration flows and manage our connectivity to our services and endpoints. As we begin, there is nothing here yet, so let’s build some integration logic. Let’s see how simple it is to create our flow for an API. First, we need to create a model for our contact. |<br>\n| <strong>Action</strong> 2.1.1 Click <strong>Create flows for an API</strong> .                                                                                                                                                                       |<br>\n| <strong>Action</strong> 2.1.2 Rename the API <strong>Contact API</strong> (1), name the model <strong>Contact</strong> (2), and click <strong>Create model</strong> (3).                                                                                                                |</p>\n<p>| <strong>2.2</strong> <strong>Create properties</strong>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |<br>\n| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |<br>\n| <strong>Narration</strong> Let’s start by defining our properties. There will be an ID, FirstName, LastName, Email, Address, Phone, and Mobile. As you can see, we are developing our API based on a model. It’s completely model-driven, and we’ve just modeled our ‘Contact’ object. Next, we’ll design and implement the operation that is related to this ‘Contact’ model.              |<br>\n| <strong>Action</strong> 2.2.1 In the property name, enter <strong>ID</strong> and click <strong>Add property</strong> .

We will use the designer flow editor to edit and change our flow to add the necessary additional steps.  Before we add to our flow, let’s adjust the response that is returned when the flow is called. This response serves to close the API flow and is a required construct. Because there is no data needed by the caller of the API flow (but a response is required), we can have a very simple response. We will add the ID to the response. |<br>\n| <strong>Action</strong> 3.1.1 Click the <strong>Response</strong> node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |<br>\n| <strong>Action</strong> 3.1.2 Enter <strong>ID</strong> in the <strong>ID</strong> field (1), and select the <strong>ID</strong> object (2).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |</p>\n<p>| <strong>3.2</strong> <strong>Retrieve contacts</strong>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |<br>\n| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |<br>\n| <strong>Narration</strong> Our API will be easy to create.

However, this is difficult because there are lots of fields, and the products will probably have different field names for the same objects. With Mapping Assist, you don’t need to type all of these mappings. We’ll use AI to simplify our work! Once Insightly’s ‘Create Contact’ node is added, mapping suggestions are automatically generated. The best possible matches (top suggestions) are presented, which can be automatically inserted into fields with a single click.

To help you understand the key features of Databand, this lab will walk through several parts of the user interface. Starting from the main dashboard, you will see how to view the overall health of the pipelines and see the top errors and failing pipelines. Then the lab continues through analyzing alerts, looking at pipeline and data quality issues. Then the tour continues over the Pipeline and Datasets panels showing how to use these to investigate issues and understand impacts of failures. The run metadata shown in the demonstration environment comes from pipeline runs in an Airflow cluster. Several of the examples you will observe are based on a hypothetical processing pipeline of live 311 (city customer service requests) data for New York City. The code for the pipelines is intentinoally configured to throw various types of errors at specific times to provide examples of typical failures in a production environment.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If you have not already done so, <a href=\"https://ibm-bp-demo.databand.ai/\">Log in to the Business Partner Databand demo environment</a>.

Let’s look at an example around Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 GHG emissions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol categorizes greenhouse gas emissions into three ‘Scopes.’ Scope 1 covers direct emissions from owned or controlled sources, such as vehicles and fuel combustion. An example of Scope 1 emissions is fleet fuel used for an organization’s vehicle fleet. Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling. An example of Scope 2 emissions is the emissions from the electricity an organization purchases to cool its data centers. Scope 3 covers indirect emissions such as purchased goods and services and business travel. An example of Scope 3 emissions is emissions from FedEx which was hired by the government (or any shipping company that was hired for that matter) to refrigerate and ship cold chain custody vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>\n https://ghgprotocol.org/about-us https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/Scope2_ExecSum_Final.pdf https://www.carbontrust.com/resources/briefing-what-are-scope-3-emissions https://www.nationalgrid.com/stories/energy-explained/what-are-scope-1-2-3-carbon-emissions</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scroll down to <strong>Metrics and Targets (A)</strong> and click the <strong>Scope 1, 2, and 3 Greenhouse gas emissions and related risks</strong> hot link <strong>(B)</strong>.</p>\n<p>Similar to the previous question you drilled down into, this page contains all of the information related to this question.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For this question, there are a number of important details to look at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Under the Methodology section is the “recipe” for answering this question and letting Envizi do all the heavy lifting and extracting the numbers from an Envizi report (A).</li>\n<li>Towards the bottom of the page, note that the Final Response is numerical.

Labeling is tagging the input images with information about its content. In object detection, this would involve highlighting occurrences of items of interest. In the case of this demo, you will go through each of the uploaded tank images and highlight the portion of the image that represents a clean or a dirty tank. During the training phase, these labelled images will allow your model to learn which part of the image represents a tank and next whether that image portion contains a clean or a dirty tank.</p>\n<p>As you can imagine, labeling the images correctly is critical to the accuracy of the model you are creating because it directly impacts the overall quality of the trained model. Quite simply, when it comes to identifying objects or classifying images, you want a use case domain expert – the person with the relevant subject matter expertise (SME) – to be labeling these images. This will ensure the highest quality of input into the model training. Traditionally, data scientists have been the focal point of AI initiatives and have wasted their precious time labelling data (despite not even being a domain expert; for example, would a data scientist be able to better label a dirty tank than the on-site inspection engineer?). With MVI, a domain expert – with no data science expertise– can label the images and then subsequently build a model based on those images.</p>\n<p>This approach lowers the barrier to entry and empowers domain experts with limited to no AI training the ability to create and deploy working AI models in a matter of hours, not days or weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Spanish Helper:</strong> En este paso, etiquetará las imágenes del tanque.

At this point, you have labelled all the tank images in the uploaded data set.</p>\n<p>When building out a deep learning computer vision model, the more images added to the data set, the more accurate the model will generally be. However, there may be times when you do not have a dataset as varied or large enough to create an accurate and generalized model, and the cost of acquiring new data is too high.</p>\n<p>To address this pain point, MVI provides image augmentation capabilities, where filters can be applied to perform operations such as flip, blur, sharpen, and crop, to create additional images, thus increasing model performance and decreasing the cost to acquire more data. This augmentation process multiplies the original number of images by several folds. And the good news is that any labeling that has been done in the original images is maintained in the new augmented images to avoid rework.</p>\n<p>For this demo, it is fair to assume that a posted field camera is unlikely to take pictures of the tanks under the same conditions every time. The lighting will vary depending on weather and time of day. If the camera is rotatable, then it’s orientation to the tank and image focus can also be inconsistent. Rather than trying to provide images for all possible scenarios, image augmentation can help simulate these different conditions. This is how, data augmentation helps add additional data to your dataset to improve model performance (accuracy).

Sin embargo, puede haber ocasiones en las que no tenga un conjunto de datos tan variado o lo suficientemente grande como para crear un modelo preciso y generalizado, y el costo de adquirir nuevos datos sea demasiado alto.</p>\n<p>Para abordar este problema, MVI proporciona capacidades de aumento de imágenes, donde se pueden aplicar filtros para realizar operaciones como voltear, desenfocar, enfocar y recortar, para crear imágenes adicionales, lo que aumenta el rendimiento del modelo y reduce el costo de adquirir más datos. Este proceso de aumento multiplica el número original de imágenes por varios pliegues. Y la buena noticia es que cualquier etiquetado que se haya hecho en las imágenes originales se mantiene en las nuevas imágenes aumentadas para evitar reelaboraciones.</p>\n<p>Para esta demostración, es justo suponer que es poco probable que una cámara de campo publicada tome fotografías de los tanques en las mismas condiciones cada vez. La iluminación variará dependiendo del clima y la hora del día. Si la cámara es giratoria, entonces su orientación hacia el tanque y el enfoque de la imagen también pueden ser inconsistentes.

In the case of vision-based models, this data takes the form of images or videos. Built-in MVI ML models intelligently detect and learn patterns in the uploaded dataset and analyze this data repeatedly until it can discern distinctions and ultimately recognizes objects of interest in the images. For example, to train a computer to recognize automobile tires, you need to feed it with vast quantities of tire images and tire-related items to learn the differences and identify a tire, especially one with defects.</p>\n<p>For this use case model, you will create a dataset with a limited number of clean and dirty tank images for brevity; however, in real world scenarios, a computer vision model would require many more images and processing time than this demonstration offers.</p>\n<p>In this demo, you manually upload saved tank images from your local machine to the MVI application dashboard, however, built-in image capture modes in MVI Mobile and MVI Edge applications (parts of the MVI solution) can also be used to collect and copy images automatically into the MVI application.

Hence to follow along as an example, if you are instructed to click on the <strong><em>Sedimentation Tanks</em></strong> dataset, you would instead click on <strong><em>Sedimentation Tanks &#x3C;YOUR INITIALS></em></strong> dataset, i.e., the dataset you named along with your unique identifier.</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Click on the lower half of the newly created <strong>Sedimentation Tanks</strong> tile (where a light grey image icon is shown).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once you click on this tile, a window opens for the data set you just created.

Labeling is tagging the input images with information about its content. In object detection, this would involve highlighting occurrences of items of interest. In the case of this demo, you will go through each of the uploaded tank images and highlight the portion of the image that represents a clean or a dirty tank. During the training phase, these labelled images will allow your model to learn which part of the image represents a tank and next whether that image portion contains a clean or a dirty tank.</p>\n<p>As you can imagine, labeling the images correctly is critical to the accuracy of the model you are creating because it directly impacts the overall quality of the trained model. Quite simply, when it comes to identifying objects or classifying images, you want a use case domain expert – the person with the relevant subject matter expertise (SME) – to be labeling these images. This will ensure the highest quality of input into the model training. Traditionally, data scientists have been the focal point of AI initiatives and have wasted their precious time labelling data (despite not even being a domain expert; for example, would a data scientist be able to better label a dirty tank than the on-site inspection engineer?). With MVI, a domain expert – with no data science expertise– can label the images and then subsequently build a model based on those images.</p>\n<p>This approach lowers the barrier to entry and empowers domain experts with limited to no AI training the ability to create and deploy working AI models in a matter of hours, not days or weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>\n<p>Once all the pictures are uploaded in MVI perform the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>From the Select files dropdown click <strong>All (A)</strong> to automatically select all the dataset images.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Click <strong>Label objects (B)</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <strong>Label objects / Sedimentation Tanks</strong> page opens.

At this point, you have labelled all the tank images in the uploaded data set.</p>\n<p>When building out a deep learning computer vision model, the more images added to the data set, the more accurate the model will generally be. However, there may be times when you do not have a dataset as varied or large enough to create an accurate and generalized model, and the cost of acquiring new data is too high.</p>\n<p>To address this pain point, MVI provides image augmentation capabilities, where filters can be applied to perform operations such as flip, blur, sharpen, and crop, to create additional images, thus increasing model performance and decreasing the cost to acquire more data. This augmentation process multiplies the original number of images by several folds. And the good news is that any labeling that has been done in the original images is maintained in the new augmented images to avoid rework.</p>\n<p>For this demo, it is fair to assume that a posted field camera is unlikely to take pictures of the tanks under the same conditions every time. The lighting will vary depending on weather and time of day. If the camera is rotatable, then it’s orientation to the tank and image focus can also be inconsistent. Rather than trying to provide images for all possible scenarios, image augmentation can help simulate these different conditions. This is how, data augmentation helps add additional data to your dataset to improve model performance (accuracy).

Training is the process of fitting a model to the input data such that it can be used to make predictions on data it hasn’t seen before in the future.</p>\n<p>During computer vision model training, pixel-level information from the image dataset is fed into the training algorithm. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) helps the algorithm “look” by breaking images into pixels (CNN is a popular algorithm for computer vision). This neural network also checks the accuracy of its predictions in a series of iterations until its predictions are accurate. At this point, the CNN model is recognizing or seeing images like a human’s biological neural network (hence the name – Convolutional <em>Neural Network</em>). In this demo, the model you will train is <strong>Faster R-CNN</strong> (Faster Region-based Convolutional Network). <strong>Faster R- CNN</strong> is an extension of the CNN models that belongs to a family of object detection computer vision models.</p>\n<p>The good news is that Maximo Visual Inspection simplifies and streamlines this model training process through automation and a no-code solution; this puts deep learning into the hands of an empowered subject matter expert.</p>\n<p>Now it’s time to start the training process of your dirty tank detection model using MVI’s power of AI and ease of use.</p>\n<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click <strong>Train model</strong> to start the object detection training process.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The Train Model / Augmented Sedimentation Tank page opens.

Also, you will use the <strong>Faster R-CNN</strong> model type, which is optimized for higher accuracy but takes more computing and GPU power than alternatives (that’s ok; you want higher accuracy).</p>\n<p>Apart from the chosen options, Maximo Visual Inspection (MVI) includes several models to run inferences related to classification and detection. A brief description of when to use each model type can be read within each training and model option tile.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>To gain more control over the model training, view your model’s hyperparameters by clicking on <strong>Advanced settings</strong> switch to turn it <strong>On</strong> (located in the upper right corner of the screen).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Due to MVI’s ease of use, domain experts often progress very quickly into becoming advanced users. As they find themselves with new levels of comfort and control, they can also optionally choose to exploit advanced settings to further fine-tune the model. Once the <strong>Advanced settings</strong> switch is turned on, the <strong>model hyperparameters</strong> section becomes available at the bottom of the screen. Hyperparameters are used to optimize the model’s performance; and when it comes to improving the model accuracy, these parameters are the go-to option for data scientists and model experts. A brief description on each of the hyperparameters can be viewed by clicking on the <strong>info</strong> icon (the “<strong>i</strong>” in a circle) at the end of each corresponding hyperparameter. For now, keep hyperparameters at their default values.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> If you are doing this demo in a classroom setting, or time is a factor, you can keep the number of iterations low. Setting it to a higher value will take longer, but it also means a more accurate model with better inspection results; for the demo, you can leave the hyperparameters at their default values.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>While you could click the blue <strong>Train model</strong> button at the top to begin the model training process, this is <strong>NOT</strong> recommended in a live demo setting. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Clicking on <strong>“Train Model”</strong> will start the training process, but since the training here will take 25+ minutes, this guide shows you the next steps using a more practical pre-built model that has been built using the same steps but was trained using 2000+ clean and dirty tank images and hours of computation.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing, only two Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are available for model training and deployment in the worldwide shared demo cluster (you can view the current GPU usage at the top right of the screen).</p>\n<p>Therefore, when you click Train Model, the training process is likely queued until resources (GPUs) become available again. If this happens, you will see a window prompting you to add the training job to the queue or cancel the training altogether. You can click Cancel to terminate the training process and avoid system overload.</p>\n<p>For demo purposes, from this point on, you will use a prebuilt sedimentation tanks model “DONOT DELETE- Sedimentation tank model” built on 2000+ tank images to showcase the next steps (just like on a cooking show where the meal is already cooked in the oven, and they just take it out on the show).</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Click the <strong>Hamburger</strong> icon (a stacked bar) on the top left to view the list of page navigation options <strong>(A)</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Deployed models</strong> from the list to view a list of pre-deployed models <strong>(B)</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Deployed models page opens.

In this way you are simulating the scenario of a new tank inspection image sent down to the model by the field cameras and subject the model to tank images it has never seen before.</p>\n<p>Using a dataset that was not part of the model-building phase is a standard process to check the model performance (accuracy).

In <strong>Collecting</strong> mode, any images taken as part of the inspection are simply collected to train an AI model at a later stage. In <strong>Inspecting</strong> mode, these images are inspected by a previously trained AI model to perform inference (detect the image elements using computer vision).

Inspections can be initiated by either setting MQTT topic triggers, which will perform inspections by receiving remote triggers, or by setting time-based intervals. Inspection interval settings can be set according to the business requirements; for example, tank inspections could be set to take place every 24 hours (in seconds) etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> To avoid unexpected errors in the demo environment you are not actually triggering a new inspection in this demo.

There is a green check mark for a clean tank and a <strong>red X</strong> for a dirty tank. There may also be a yellow question mark if the model is unsure about the result. A high rate of inconclusive results might indicate that the model’s performance is poor, the rule configuration is incorrect, or the quality of the camera images is compromised.</p>\n<p>The exclamation points in the triangle indicate that the inspection result has been sent as alert notifications to Maximo Monitor via <strong>MQTT or SMS via Twilio</strong>, depending on the option(s) you selected in the Rules settings phase. Clicking on each of these images can show further details about the inspection, such as here you can see that the most recent tank inspection failed due to the poor tank condition, and an alert was immediately sent out about the inspection’s result.

Please note, in addition to the MVI training server, you would also need access to an iOS mobile device (iPad or an iPhone) to demo this part because the MVI Mobile application is only available on iOS mobile devices (at the time of writing).</p>\n<p><em>Figure 2: Access to the MVI training server and iOS Mobile device is required</em></p>\n<p>Now, let us see how a model trained on the Maximo Visual Inspection server can be used to perform inspections using IBM Maximo Visual Inspection Mobile (MVI Mobile) app. Maximo Visual Inspection (MVI) Mobile is a native iOS/iPadOS mobile app that runs on Apple devices such as the iPhone and iPad. This provides a low barrier to entry in terms of hardware costs and time to value. The sophisticated optics on Apple devices are combined with the ability to run models generated from the MVI core application, with native 5G support allowing clients to run<br>\ninspections at scale.</p>\n<p>Like the rest of the applications in the MVI solution, MVI Mobile delivers agility with point-and-click ease but through the footprint of a mobile app, while providing a powerful real-time AI-powered inspection point and data management platform. In a matter of hours, clients can train complex computer vision models on the core MVI platform and deploy the trained model to the MVI Mobile device to perform inferencing.</p>\n<p>The mobile application can be configured by either a handheld mode or a fixed position mode. For example, consider a fixed camera that can take photos of welds on a manufacturing line and perform an automated inspection on the spot. Being able to determine at this point that a particular weld is bad has many benefits. Not only are you preventing this part from finding its way into the hands of a customer (either as the part itself or as a component in a larger item) – which could have disastrous consequences, depending on the item – but this could be a symptom of an issue with the welding equipment, and identifying and fixing the problem early means less wasted product. Similarly, with the hand-held mode a quality inspector can easily carry the mobile device to an inspection site and harness the power of a powerful AI model to detect any anomalies by simply clicking a picture of the inspected part. The result is a dramatic improvement in production quality inspection.</p>\n<p>The following part of this demo will demonstrate the core capabilities of MVI Mobile using the pre-trained water sedimentation computer vision model.</p>","location":"/en/maximo/visualinspection/visual-inspection2#mvi-mobile-inspections-and-optional-sms-alerts","page":"Visual Inspection - Part 2"},"326":{"title":"Step 1: Integrating MVI Mobile with the MVI Training server","text":"<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Login to MVI training server (the software where you created the AI model in).</li>\n<li>On Welcome to <strong>IBM Maximo Visual Inspection</strong> screen, click on the <strong>hamburger icon (A)</strong> to open the left side panel.

Watson Studio provides a variety of cutting-edge tools that can not only speed up many mundane tasks for expert data scientists, but can also allow \"citizen data scientists\" (subject matter experts who may not be comfortable writing code) to contribute.</p>\n<p>SPSS Modeler is a low-code solution for transforming data and building models.

For example, +1.18 for no attrition and -0.73 for attrition</li>\n<li><strong>probability</strong>: probability of each event to occur, or a measure of confidence the model has in its prediction. The closer the value is to 1, the more confident the model is. Example: 0.914 and 0.086</li>\n<li><strong>prediction</strong>: Result of the prediction. For example: 1 if the model predicts the employee will leave the company, or 0 if the model predicts the employee will stay</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With these additional fields you don't only know what the model predicted, but its confidence level as well. An application could take advantage of this by raising an alert when the confidence level is below a certain threshold.</p>\n<p>In testing, if the confidence level is always 100%, it would most likely indicate a problem with the model; for example, it might suggest that the model is too specific to the training data and you are testing with data that was used for training.</p>\n<p>The output of a model varies depending on which tool or library is used. Still, having the result in JSON format allows for some flexibility on processing these results if multiple models created with different tools and libraries are used.</p>","location":"/en/mlops/104#3.-test-a-model-through-the-user-interface-(ui)","page":"104: Deploying models and functions"},"376":{"title":"4.

OpenScale can train the drift monitor using the training data you provided a connection to in an earlier step.</li>\n<li>Click on the <strong>Edit</strong> icon on the <strong>Drift model</strong> tile on the right. Select the <strong>Train in Watson OpenScale</strong> radio button, and click on <strong>Next</strong>. OpenScale will train a separate drift model that compares model inputs to the training data, and predicts model accuracy. For example, if the data submitted to the model is similar to training data that the model struggles to accurately predict, then OpenScale's drift model can warn of potential accuracy issues in real time. The drift model can be automatically trained by OpenScale if it has access to the training data, or manually trained by a user with notebook code provided in the link on the configuration screen.</li>\n<li>Leave the alert thresholds set as they are, and click on <strong>Next</strong> again.</li>\n<li>Set the <strong>Minimum sample size</strong> to <strong>100</strong> and click on <strong>Save</strong>. OpenScale begins training the drift model in the background as you configure other monitors. In a real world scenario, you would leave these minimum sample at their default values or even raise them. However, for the purposes of this lab, lowering them will allow you to see results from the model monitoring more easily.</li>\n<li>Click on the <strong>Quality</strong> monitor from the list of <strong>Evaluations</strong> on the left, then click on the <strong>Edit</strong> icon on the <strong>Quality thresholds</strong> tile on the right.</li>\n<li>Note the wide variety of quality metrics provided by OpenScale, and that each one can be configured with a different alert threshold. For now, leave them all set at 0.8 and click on <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n<li>Once again, set the <strong>Minimum sample size</strong> to <strong>100</strong> and click on <strong>Save</strong>. You are now finished configuring monitors for this model. Note that you did not configure a fairness monitor for this particular model. If you were to deploy the AutoAI hiring model you built in the <a href=\"/mlops/103\">No-code and low-code solutions</a> section, you could configure OpenScale to monitor fairness for any of the fields included in that model.</li>\n</ol>","location":"/en/mlops/105#1.-configure-openscale-monitoring","page":"105: Validating and monitoring models"},"383":{"title":"2.

Use that one for this lab and demos.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>From the offense page, filtered by Compliance related events, click<br>\nthe <strong>Compliance Events on GDPR Ass...</strong> offense that displays the<br>\nuser mcoy as the Offense Source.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the offense details page, click the <strong>ellipsis</strong> to see the full<br>\nname of the offense.</p>\n<p>Note that the name of this offense is very long. That is due to the<br>\n<em><strong>offense chaining</strong></em> feature combining multiple insights contributing<br>\nto the offense using the same index. Those insights are linked or<br>\nchained by using the <strong>proceed by</strong> keyword.</p>\n<p>Before we dive into the insights of this offense, let's examine the<br>\nupper part of the page, where you can find offense summary data.</p>\n<p>The Offense Type tells you about the root information that was used to<br>\ncollect data. We also call that parameter the offense index. The two<br>\nmost common offense types are Source IP, Destination IP and Username.</p>\n<p>This offense is indexed by <em>username</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the Offense Source USER <strong>mcoy</strong>.</p>\n<p>When you open the details pane for the Offense Source or username, you<br>\nmight get additional information about that user, which then leads you<br>\nto drill down into the User Behavior Analytics (UBA) app. We will<br>\ndiscuss the UBA app in more detail a bit later.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Close the User details side pane and return to the offense details<br>\npage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Expand the <strong>Source IP</strong> and <strong>Destination IP</strong> addresses.</p>\n<p>Besides the offense being indexed on username, the offense collects all<br>\ninternal and external Source and Destination IP addresses from the logs<br>\n(and flows) contributing to the offense.</p>\n<p>The next important detail we want to investigate is the magnitude of the<br>\noffense.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the <strong>Magnitude</strong> region.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Review the Offense Magnitude side pane.</p>\n<p>The magnitude provides a score on how bad the issue is associated with<br>\nthe offense. The magnitude is calculated based on the relevance and<br>\nseverity of the events contributing to the offense, as well as the<br>\ncredibility, which depends on a level assigned to the log source that<br>\nprocesses the event. For example, the credibility of IBM Security<br>\nGuardium logs might be considered higher than logs from a web server<br>\nthat does not handle personally identifiable information (PII).</p>\n<p>Note the formula displayed on the screen that shows how the magnitude is<br>\ncalculated.</p>\n<p>RELEVANCE x <strong>50%</strong> + SEVERITY x <strong>30%</strong> + CREDIBILITY x <strong>20%</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that the magnitude score decreases over time. This is sensible because the older the offense is, the less relevant it becomes. The magnitude score ranges between 0 and 10. The higher the score, the more urgently the offense is in need of analysis for potential security issues.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Close the Offense Magnitude pane and return the offense summary<br>\nscreen.</p>\n<p>Observe that offense includes multiple source and destination IP<br>\naddresses relevant to mcoy activity. Also, QRadar reports on MITRE<br>\nATT&#x26;CK tactics and techniques observed in this offense. It can also be<br>\nrelevant for the analyst to observe the event categories that<br>\ncontributed to this offense.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>From the offense details page, click the <strong>number of</strong> events in the <strong>Categories</strong>.</p>\n<p>QRadar uses event categories to group incoming events for processing.<br>\nThe event categories are searchable and help you monitor your network.<br>\nEach event that occurs on your network has associated high-level and<br>\nlow-level categories.

A security analyst would know that there is no<br>\nplausible reason for direct interaction between external networks and a<br>\ndomain controller. Next, let's look at one of the external IPs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Close the side asset panel and click the external IP<br>\n<strong>216.239.32.21</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Review the IP address side panel.</p>\n<p>Note that this IP address depicts a low X-Force risk score at this time.<br>\nThis is real-time information pulled from the IBM X-Force Exchange<br>\ndatabase.

The IP address was also part of multiple collections that<br>\nwere used to track different threat campaigns. All this data is<br>\nintegrated with QRadar SIEM and can be used to improve detection and<br>\ninvestigation of malicious activities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Close the X-Force Exchange window and the IP address side panel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>From the search page, go back to the offense by clicking <strong>Return to<br>\nOffense &#x3C;n></strong>.</p>\n<p>Let's review the next insight in this offense, Suspicious Activity on<br>\nPersonal Data Detected by DLP Devices.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the <strong>Suspicious Activity on Personal Data Detected by DLP<br>\nDevices</strong> insight.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Review the Notes and Tests sections related to this insight.</p>\n<p>Looking at the Notes section and the Tests related to this insight, you<br>\nrealize that the test triggers if a DLP (Data Loss Prevention) service<br>\ndetects a policy or rule defined in the <em>GDPR DLP Policies</em> reference<br>\nset. We will look at those tests and the insights in more detail a bit<br>\nlater using the Use Case Manager app, but now let's review the events<br>\nrelated to this test and the offense.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At the bottom of the side window, click <strong>View Event Details</strong>.</p>\n<p>The new search is automatically formed showing the Guardium events that<br>\nobserved activities between internal systems. The destination systems<br>\nare marked red, which means those are critical assets.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the Event Details screen, click the critical IP <strong>10.4.0.26</strong></p>\n<p>This asset is labelled as a CRM database and the owner is Mary Coy, who<br>\nis also involved in this offense. This either indicates malicious<br>\ninsider threat activity or an outside adversary using stolen<br>\ncredentials. Let's continue the investigation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Exit the asset details pane and go back to the search results<br>\nwindow.</p>\n<p>Let's look at the <em>Admin Commands by non DBA - Alert</em> event in more<br>\ndetail.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Admin Commands by non DBA -- Alert</strong>.</p>\n<p>This Guardium event is marked critical. If we scroll to the bottom of<br>\nthe event details pane, we can see what insights (QRadar rules and<br>\nbuilding blocks) were fully or partially matched in this event. Any<br>\nmatched rules or building blocks can contribute to an offense or create<br>\na new one.</p>\n<p>You can also see the full payload, how the event is received by QRadar<br>\nfrom Guardium.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If not already expanded, expand the <strong>Custom Properties</strong> section.</p>\n<p>In the <strong>Custom Properties</strong> section, you can see what parameters<br>\nare extracted from the event payload. One of them is the policy name --<br>\n<em><strong>GDPR Personal Data Admin User -- alert per match (violation) on DML<br>\nand Select Commands</strong></em>. Make note of this policy name, because we will<br>\nreference it later in the lab and demo.</p>\n<p>You also see the user, mcoy, who executed the database SQL command.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Open payload</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Review the payload details page.</p>\n<p>On this page, you can see how the raw payload looks. If you identify some<br>\nrelevant data in the payload, you could create an additional custom<br>\nproperty to extract the information, which you can use in the rules<br>\nprocessing the events.</p>\n<p>This eases the daily activities for your Security Analysts because they<br>\nno longer need to review a lot of raw payloads. Instead, QRadar<br>\nautomatically extracts important fields in the custom properties and<br>\nuses the custom rules engine, tests, and insights to digest the<br>\ninformation for the analyst, packaging all pieces of information into a<br>\nmore human-readable package, which we call an offense.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Close</strong> the payload details page.</p>\n<p>Let's go back to the offense.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Close the side panel, too.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>From the Search page, click <strong>Return to Offense &#x3C;n></strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The offense number might vary.</p>\n<p>We can continue to examine every insight and analyze them in more depth.<br>\nBut, even by reading the Insights titles, we can see the unfolding<br>\nattack story: the Domain Controller was communicating with remote IP<br>\naddresses with a bad reputation. Then the mcoy account executed<br>\nsuspicious activity on the CRM database -- maybe data was exfiltrated.<br>\nAnd then, the account tried to log in to another system and eventually<br>\nsucceeded. All this data was collected in 45 events. The <em>offense<br>\nchaining</em> feature summarizes the threat in the offense title by<br>\ncombining multiple insights into one offense connected with the word<br>\n<strong>proceeded by</strong>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Based on the detailed offense analysis, an analyst can perform a variety of actions on the offense, such as closing false positives or escalating the offense to an incident response or a ticketing system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Actions</strong> to list the actions that can be performed on the offense.</p>\n<p>If the offense is deemed false positive, the analyst should close it. It is not considered a good practice to defer or not perform offense closure because QRadar gets trained based on the offense closing reason the analyst specifies. Closing offenses also helps with performance.</p>\n<p>If you do not properly manage the offenses, they may expire. If necessary, an analyst can also freeze an offense to avoid expiration.</p>\n<p>In this case, the incident is a real threat and requires an incident response. Thus, you can send the offense information to QRadar SOAR for<br>\nfurther incident response. That action is beyond the scope of this lab.</p>\n<p>Therefore, leave the offense in the current active state.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Close the action popup menu.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So far, we have demonstrated how a security analyst can use offenses to<br>\nanalyze information that QRadar has received and processed. We performed<br>\ndetailed offense analysis and highlighted important artifacts, such as<br>\nindex, magnitude, event categories, insights, and events.</p>\n<p>Let's now take a close look into QRadar use cases and rules with the Use Case Manager app.</p>","location":"/en/qradar-siem/102#offense-3-compliance-events-on-gdpr-assets...-(indexed-by-user-mcoy)","page":"102: QRadar SIEM Demo"},"416":{"title":"Analyzing rules with the Use Case Manager app","text":"<blockquote>\n<p>The compliance and threat landscapes are constantly evolving.

This lab guide provides a set of exercises that demonstrate how to use the QRadar User Behavior Analytics (UBA) application.</p>\n<p>The QRadar User Behavior Analytics app is a tool for detecting insider threats in your organization. It is built on top of the app framework to use existing data in your QRadar environment to generate new insights around users and risk. UBA adds two major functions to QRadar: risk profiling and unified user identities.</p>\n<p>Risk profiling is done by assigning risk to different security use cases. Examples might include simple rules and checks such as bad websites, or more advanced stateful analytics that use machine learning. Risk is assigned to each one depending on the severity and reliability of the incident detected. UBA uses existing event and flow data in your QRadar system to generate these insights and profile risks of users.</p>\n<p>UBA uses three types of traffic that enrich UBA and enable more use cases to profile risk. The three types are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Traffic around access, authentication, and account changes.</li>\n<li>User behavior on the network, so devices such as: proxies, firewalls, IPS, and VPNs.</li>\n<li>Endpoint and application logs, such as from Windows or Linux, and SaaS applications.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Unifying user identities is accomplished by combining disparate accounts for a user in QRadar. By importing data from an Active Directory, an LDAP server, Reference table, or CSV file, UBA can be taught what accounts belong to a user identity. This helps combine risk and traffic across the different user names in UBA.</p>\n<p>The user risk profile is measured by a risk score that is a cumulative number assigned to the user, based on the log activity recorded in QRadar SIEM. UBA applies analytics and various machine learning algorithms to the vast QRadar SIEM data.</p>\n<p>Machine Learning (ML app) is an add-on tool that augments the UBA app. It enables more rich and in-depth use cases that perform time series profiling and clustering. It is installed from within the UBA app, on the Machine Learning settings page.

Turbonomic is an Application Resource Management (ARM) platform designed to put your hybrid environment into the<br>\noptimal state by achieving three primary goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>assuring the performance of your applications by making sure that the applications get the resources they need when they need them</li>\n<li>using limited on-premises and cloud resources as efficiently as possible at the lowest cost, and finally</li>\n<li>adhering to any compliance and business policies required by your organization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the Turbonomic ARM is deployed and selected environments are targeted, Turbonomic discovers all the entities in the targeted environments.

See the example below.</p>\n<p>The direction of the arrows is also meaningful. They show the direction of the purchase's resources. Turbonomic sees the resources available as a marketplace. Every entity can sell resources and/or buy them. For example, a VM buys resources from the host it is residing on and then sells them to the application components running on it. In this scenario, a VM is both a consumer of resources (from the physical host) and a supplier of resources (for the application components).

This business application consists of 23 business transactions <strong>(A)</strong>, 12 services <strong>(B)</strong>, and 20 application components <strong>(C)</strong> running in 18 containers <strong>(D)</strong> that sit on top 2 virtual machines <strong>(E)</strong>.

These information comes from the connected APM tool – in this case Instana, what is indicated in the upper left corner <strong>(I)</strong>.</p>\n<p>The structure of supply chain was also imported from Instana, where Business Application is defined as a logical grouping of Business Transactions, Services and Application Components.</p>\n<p>Click the <strong>Business Transaction</strong></p>\n<p>If you scope to the Business Transaction, it represents a capability within your Business Application that fulfills a response to a user-initiated request.

Turbonomic can recommend actions to adjust the amount of resources available to Application Components.</p>\n<p>Turbonomic does not recommend actions for a Business Application, Transactions, or Services, but it does recommend actions for the underlying Application Components and infrastructure entities, thus providing visibility into the risks that have a direct impact on the Business Application's performance. For example, you can see here the actions to resize down both the heap (memory allocation) for a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the virtual machine (VM) that hosts that JVM.</p>\n<p>Let’s explore the Turbonomic actions in more detail.</p>\n<p>Click the green <strong>ON</strong> button in the top-left corner to return to the Turbonomic home page. Click <strong>SHOW ALL</strong> at the bottom of the <strong>Pending Actions</strong> widget.</p>\n<p>You can see here in the Pending Actions widget the types of actions that are generated. These can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“placement” actions to move a virtual machine to the most desirable host or storage from one tier to another</li>\n<li>“delete” actions to remove storage volumes that have been orphaned</li>\n<li>“scaling” actions to resize a virtual machine, container, or database</li>\n<li>“stop” or “suspend” actions to turn off idle resources to avoid unnecessary charges, and</li>\n<li>“start / buy” actions to turn on new VMs, provision a new host, or buy reserved instances (RIs) in the cloud.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this example, there are more than 500 actions that can be taken to move this hybrid environment into the optimal or what we call the desired state. You can see there are actions to scale up the virtual CPU or virtual memory of virtual machines, provision actions to add a host in a cluster where resources are low and move actions to move a virtual machine from one host to another.</p>\n<p>Because there are hundreds and sometimes thousands of actions in an environment, Turbonomic allows you to apply filters to the list of actions to help you quickly sort the list. Clicking ADD FILTER and opening the dropdown, you can filter the actions by action type, action mode, action category, action prerequisite, or entity type.</p>\n<p>You may ask “How does an SRE know that these are the right actions to take?” For each action, Turbonomic not only shows you the current state of the environment, but it also shows the positive impact on the environment if the suggested action is taken. Let’s expand a couple of actions to showcase this starting with a move action.</p>\n<p>Expand <strong>Move</strong> -> <strong>Virtual Machines</strong> (or <strong>Move</strong>  -> <strong>Container Pods</strong> if the other is not visible).  Click the <strong>DETAILS</strong> button on any record.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: Depending on the action selected the risk detected (a reason for action to be generated) – PERFORMANCE in this case – may be different. Adjust your narration accordingly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you look at the description of this move action, the VM (or Container Pod) is moving to a new host due to memory congestion on the current host. For each of the metrics shown, the value on the left is the current state while the value on the right is the projected state after the action is taken.</p>\n<p>Next, let’s look at a VM scaling action.</p>\n<p>Expand <strong>Scale</strong> -> <strong>Virtual Machines</strong>. Click <strong>DETAILS</strong> of any VM scale action.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: Depending on the action selected, the associated graphs and action details may be different. Adjust your narration accordingly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For virtual machine scaling, Turbonomic uses percentile calculations to measure virtual CPU and virtual memory utilization more accurately, and drive scaling actions that improve overall utilization and reduce cost for cloud VMs. When you examine the details for a pending scaling action on a VM, you will see charts that highlight virtual CPU and/or virtual memory utilization percentiles for a given observation period, and the projected percentiles after you execute the action. Turbonomic’s aggressiveness setting is 95th percentile with an observation period setting of 30 days. This means that in this example, Turbonomic shows that the vCPU utilization is below 93% for 95% of the time over the last 30 days. Because this is well above the current setting for the desired state of 70%, there is an action to resize up the vCPU. You can see that after this resize action is taken, the vCPU percentile utilization is projected to be below 62% for 95% of the time. The reason that you see the vMem percentile increasing is because there is a corresponding resize down action for vMem that is not shown here.</p>\n<p>An important point to highlight here is that these actions are not simply recommendations on what a user should do; these are actions that can be taken within the Turbonomic platform.<br>\nFor example, if the action mode is set to manual, an SRE can click on this checkbox, scroll up, and click <strong>EXECUTE ACTIONS</strong> and this VM will move to the new host, or in the case of the resizing action, the VM will be resized. Taking this even further, you can create automation policies so that Turbonomic takes a preventative approach to automatically take these actions before issues occur.</p>\n<p>This keeps the environment in the desired state without human intervention and minimizes the amount of time that IT teams must spend debugging application resourcing issues after they occur and assures that the applications get the resources they need exactly when they need them.</p>\n<p>In other words, Turbonomic assures that the demand of the applications is met in real-time by the supply of available IT resources. Finally, these actions can be scheduled to execute during a maintenance window and even get approvals via change requests through Turbonomic’s integration with ServiceNow. Let’s explore how SRE can set up automation policies.</p>\n<p>Let’s create a single automation policy for virtual machine placement and resize. In addition, let’s assume that you want placement actions to execute anytime the action is generated and you want resize up and down actions for vCPU and vMem to occur nightly.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Policies</strong> > <strong>NEW POLICY</strong> > <strong>Automation Policy</strong> > <strong>Virtual Machines</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Give the policy a name: e.g. “VM_placement_resize”.</li>\n<li>Scope this policy to a group of VMs and in this case, let’s automate within a single cluster(select <strong>ad_win</strong>).</li>\n<li>Under <strong>AUTOMATION WORKFLOW</strong>, click <strong>ADD ACTION</strong>. You can choose the action type to <strong>Move</strong> to automate placement, <strong>Action Generation</strong> to <strong>Automated</strong>, then <strong>Submit</strong>.</li>\n<li>To add resize automation, click <strong>ADD ACTION</strong> again. You can choose the four action types <strong>vCPU Resize Up</strong>, <strong>vMem Resize Up</strong>, <strong>vCPU Resize Down</strong>, and <strong>vMem Resize Down</strong> to automate VM resizes.</li>\n<li>Set Action Generate to Automatic.</li>\n<li>For resizes, we said you wanted to do them on a schedule between midnight and 5 am, which can be done with an Action Execution Schedule.

Typically Turbonomic observes the entity over a period of time and captures the 95th percentile for it. Considering the example shown in the picture below, Turbonomic tells us that the IOPS utilization is about 100% 95% of the time during a 30-day observation period. This means there is an IOPS congestion on this volume so a scaling action is generated for this entity to move it to a more suitable volume.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The IOPS 95th percentile graph.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>IOPS daily average graph.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The dotted line represents the projected 95th percentile after taking this action.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Detailed comparison between the current state of the resources and the projected result after taking the action.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Detailed cost savings comparison if you take this action.

Let's<br>\nlearn all about them!</p>\n<p><strong>How do custom extensions work?</strong></p>\n<p>To create a custom extension, a developer uploads a description of an external service’s API.<br>\nThe description is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that describes the external service’s<br>\nAPI per the OpenAPI Specification. The <a href=\"https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/\">OpenAPI Specification</a> is a widely adopted standard for<br>\ndescribing RESTful APIs. (For more on RESTful APIs, visit <a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api\">this</a> Red Hat page.)</p>\n<p>Where do developers get this description of an external service’s API? Given that OpenAPI is a<br>\nwidely adopted standard, many software vendors publish OpenAPI specs publicly on their<br>\nwebsites or documentation. If an OpenAPI spec is not readily available, there are various ways to<br>\ncreate one from scratch or from existing information – such as from <a href=\"https://medium.com/ibm-watson/watson-assistant-just-got-connected-a1f46dc9b130\">IBM App Connect</a> or a <a href=\"https://medium.com/ibm-watson/from-curl-to-an-extension-under-5-minutes-c4662d95c21a\">cURL command</a>.</p>\n<p>Once a developer creates a custom extension in watsonx Assistant, a non-technical builder can<br>\nuse the extension in Actions. Remember that Actions have steps, and each step can ask the end<br>\nuser to provide a response. Actions also store information in variables. When a builder uses an<br>\nextension, they can pass information to the extension, which was gathered in earlier steps or<br>\nstored in variables. The extension also hands information back to the Action, and the builder can<br>\nreference these in later steps or store them as variables. All of this is done in the Actions page,<br>\nwithout writing any code.</p>\n<p>If you’re having trouble visualizing this, that’s okay – let’s build an example together!</p>\n<p><strong>Custom extension starter kits</strong></p>\n<p>To build out the examples in this lab, you will reference a few starter kits maintained by the<br>\nwatsonx Assistant development team to help organizations get started with custom extensions.</p>\n<p>You can view the starter kits <a href=\"https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-toolkit/tree/master/integrations/extensions#readme\">here</a>.

The<br>\nOpenAPI spec you uploaded to create the extension expects a label with that exact name and<br>\nspelling. You can double check by clicking the <strong>&#x3C;/> icon (4)</strong> and noting that the <strong>Internal name</strong> is<br>\nexactly <strong>membership_status (5)</strong>. When ready, click <strong>Next (6)</strong>:</p>\n<p>Select <strong>Single-line text</strong> as the field <strong>type (1)</strong>, then <strong>Next (2)</strong>:</p>\n<p>Click <strong>Create</strong> in the bottom right:</p>\n<p>Note that a popup on the top of your screen confirms that the new property was created:</p>\n<p>Now, return to the <strong>Contacts</strong> page by clicking <strong>Contacts (1)</strong> in the top menu, then <strong>Contacts (2)</strong><br>\nfrom the dropdown menu. Next, you will add data to the contacts in your CRM system. Click <strong>Edit columns</strong>:</p>\n<p>Search for the <strong>Record ID (1)</strong> and check its checkbox <strong>(2)</strong> to add it. Note that it appears at the<br>\nbottom of the list of <strong>selected columns (3)</strong>:</p>\n<p>Next, search for <strong>Membership status (1)</strong> and check its checkbox <strong>(2)</strong> to add it. It will also appear<br>\nat the bottom of the list of <strong>selected columns (3)</strong>:</p>\n<p>Drag <strong>Record ID</strong> and <strong>Membership status (1)</strong> up to be the second and third columns,<br>\nrespectively. <strong>Name</strong> will be the first column. Then, click <strong>Apply (2)</strong>:</p>\n<p>Your table should now look similar to the image below. Select Brian Halligan’s record by<br>\nclicking his checkbox <strong>(1),</strong> then click <strong>Edit (2)</strong>:</p>\n<p>In the ensuing popup, select <strong>Membership status (1)</strong> from the dropdown,<br>\nand type in <strong>Lendyr Topaz (2)</strong> as its value. Click <strong>Update (3)</strong>:</p>\n<p>You should now see in the Contacts table that Brian Halligan’s membership status is Lendyr<br>\nTopaz (not shown). Do not change Maria’s membership status.</p>\n<p>Congratulations! You’re ready to work with the custom extension in watsonx Assistant. Don’t<br>\nclose your HubSpot browser window just yet, you may need to come back to it once more.</p>\n<p><strong>Add the custom extension to your virtual assistant</strong></p>\n<p>Earlier, you created a custom extension to HubSpot.

(You don't need to specify the server because that was included as part of the JSON<br>\nfile provided earlier when adding the integration.) Click <strong>Next (3)</strong>.</p>\n<p>You’ll see a summary of the custom extension on the final page. Review the operations provided<br>\nby the extension, then click <strong>Finish</strong>:</p>\n<p>Click <strong>Close</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>As a builder, write the extension in an Action</strong></p>\n<p>You now have a custom extension to your HubSpot CRM system, and you’re ready to use it to<br>\npersonalize the experience of Lendyr’s end users.</p>\n<p>Earlier we noted several ways to personalize the end user experience with CRM data. Now, you<br>\nwill simply greet the end user by name and store their name, email, and membership status in the<br>\nvirtual assistant. Storing their information allows you to reference it in future Actions.</p>\n<p>Some step-by-step screenshots will be omitted—if you don’t know how to follow these<br>\ninstructions, please refer to the 102 section of this lab on building Actions.</p>\n<p>Open the <em>Actions page</em>, then create a <em>New action</em> from <em>scratch</em>. The end user should say<br>\n“Authenticate me” to start this interaction. (Not shown.)</p>\n<p>In Step 1, have the assistant ask “What is your Lendyr member number?” and define the<br>\ncustomer response as a <em>number</em>. Your screen should look similar to this:</p>\n<p>Add a second step. In Step 2, have the assistant say “Pulling in your information now…” Change<br>\n<strong>And then</strong> to “Use an extension,” which will open up an <strong>Extension setup</strong> popup window:</p>\n<p>In the panel, as shown above, select <strong>HubSpot CRM</strong> as the extension <strong>(1), Get Contact by ID</strong> as<br>\nthe <strong>Operation (2)</strong>, and set <strong>contactId</strong> to the end user’s response to step 1, <strong>“1. What is your Lendyr member number?” (3)</strong></p>\n<p>Notice how you, as the builder, are easily configuring this Action to call out to the HubSpot API<br>\nvia the extension. You can select the steps or other variables to plug into the operation with a<br>\ndropdown menu – there’s no code and no unnecessary complexity.</p>\n<p>Click <strong>Apply</strong> when you’re done. Your Step 2 should look like this:</p>\n<p>Now, create a new step. In this Step 3, since you used an extension in a previous step, you can<br>\nreference information that the extension has returned.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Assistant says</strong>, type in “Welcome, ” <strong>(1)</strong> and then click the variables icon <strong>(2)</strong>. Let’s<br>\nlook at what variables are available to you <strong>(3)</strong>:</p>\n<p>The list of variables provides a selection of values that you can reference in your assistant now<br>\nthat you’ve called the extension. Note that it includes <strong>Run successfully</strong> which indicates whether<br>\nthe API call was successful, so that you can conditionally handle the case of unrecognized<br>\ncustomer IDs.</p>\n<p>From this list, scroll down and click on <strong>body.properties.firstname</strong>. Then, as shown below <strong>(1)</strong>,<br>\ntype in an exclamation point, and a new sentence: “How can I help you today?” Lastly, change<br>\n<strong>And then</strong> to <strong>End the action (2)</strong>:</p>\n<p>There’s one more thing you need to do. Right now, the information produced by the extension is<br>\nnot stored by the assistant beyond this Action. In other words, while you can use the<br>\nbody.properties.firstname variable in Step 3, you cannot use it in an another Action.</p>\n<p>Let’s fix that. Click the <strong>fx</strong> icon in Step 3 to set variable values.</p>\n<p>Note that the <strong>Variable values</strong> view is now shown <strong>(1)</strong>. Click <strong>Set new value + (2)</strong> and scroll<br>\ndown to the bottom to select + <strong>New session variable (3)</strong>:</p>\n<p>You will create several new session variables to store information from HubSpot. <strong>Session</strong><br>\n<strong>variables</strong> are stored for the end user’s entire session – the entire time they interact with the<br>\nvirtual assistant. This will allow you to use them across Actions.</p>\n<p>In the popup, set the <strong>Name</strong> to <strong>email (1)</strong>, select <strong>Free text (2)</strong> as its type, and click <strong>Apply (3)</strong>:</p>\n<p>Back in the Step 3 view, set the email variable value to <strong>body.properties.email</strong>. Do this by<br>\nclicking on the dropdown <strong>(1)</strong>, then selecting <strong>Hubspot CRM (2)</strong>, and finally picking the<br>\n<strong>body.properties.email</strong> property (3):</p>\n<p>Now, repeat the above steps to create three more session variables named: <strong>first name</strong>, <strong>lastname</strong>,<br>\nand <strong>Membership status</strong>. (Not shown.) As you do, set each session variable to its corresponding<br>\nvalue from the custom extension. Your screen should look like the image below; don’t forget to<br>\nsave the Action by clicking on the <strong>Save icon</strong>:</p>\n<p>That’s it! You’ve successfully added an extension – a connection to an external service – into an<br>\nAction.</p>\n<p>This may have felt quite time-consuming. You spent a fair bit of time setting up the custom<br>\nextension, then setting up HubSpot. But take a moment to imagine the two distinct roles of a<br>\ndeveloper and a builder. The developer would have set up the custom extension and pulled the<br>\nauthentication token from HubSpot. At that point, they would have messaged the builder and<br>\nsaid, “Hey, you’re good to go.” The builder would have opened the Actions page and gotten<br>\nstraight to building. Each role specializes in what they’re best at: the developer doesn’t have to<br>\nwrite conversational flows, and the builder doesn’t have to write any code. That’s the power of<br>\ncustom extensions!</p>\n<p><strong>See the custom extension to a CRM system in Action</strong></p>\n<p>Before you continue, remember that the “Lendyr member number” should be one of the Record<br>\nIDs in HubSpot, which are 1 and 51 (as shown below). Any other number will not work – you<br>\nwill return to fix that problem later.</p>\n<p>Now, within the Actions window (so that you can chat in “debug” mode), open up the Preview<br>\npanel. Once you start the chat, click the <strong>variable values icon (1)</strong>:</p>\n<p>Then, have the chat shown above on the <strong>left (2)</strong> by saying “Authenticate me please!”, followed by<br>\n“51”. Note how the <strong>Action variables (3)</strong> populate and change as you converse.</p>\n<p>Next, you will inspect the extension! Click the <strong>refresh icon (4)</strong> and enter the two customer<br>\nutterances “Hi! Can you authenticate me?” and “1” (5). The assistant now calls the extension; click<br>\n<strong>Impact (6)</strong> to show the <strong>Extension inspector (7)</strong>. Note all of the properties of your HubSpot CRM<br>\nextension.</p>\n<p>You may now close your HubSpot browser window.</p>","location":"/en/watsonx/assistant/level-4/201#build-a-custom-extension-to-a-crm-system","page":"201: Custom Extensions"},"610":{"title":"Build a custom extension to a ticketing service","text":"<p>Excellent work.

Then, click <strong>Created by you (1)</strong> under the<br>\n<strong>Variables</strong> dropdown menu on the left. Note all the variables that Lendyr's Actions use to interact with end<br>\nusers (2), including the ones you created earlier: <strong>email</strong>, <strong>firstname</strong>, <strong>lastname</strong>, and<br>\n<strong>Membership status</strong>. Some of them have types - like number or free text. Others can be configured to have an<br>\ninitial value. You will leverage the fact that you might already know the end user's name, email<br>\naddress, or membership status when you create the ticket:</p>\n<p>Next, you will create another Action. On the above screen, click <strong>Created by you</strong> under the<br>\n<strong>Actions</strong> category, then click <strong>New action +</strong>, and Start from scratch. (This sequence of clicks is<br>\nnot shown, but it's the same as with all the Actions you created earlier.)</p>\n<p>What does your customer say to start this interaction? “I want to submit a support ticket.” In<br>\n<strong>Step 1</strong>, write <strong>Assistant says</strong> “Let's create a ticket for you! I will need to gather some<br>\ninformation to help you submit the ticket.” Your new Action should look like this:</p>\n<p>Next, create step 2. In this step, set <strong>Assistant says (1)</strong> to “What is your email address?” Then,<br>\n<strong>Define customer response (2)</strong> as <strong>Regex (Regular expression)</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A <em>Regular expression</em> is a sequence of characters that satisfies a specific pattern. An example is<br>\nemail; it contains a name, followed by “@,” which is then followed by a domain name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This opens a pop-up. Select <strong>Email (1)</strong> as the regular expression, then click <strong>Apply (2)</strong>.</p>\n<p>At this point, your Action should look like this:</p>\n<p>Consider that you only want to ask the end user for their email address if you don't already know<br>\nit. Thus, as shown below, change <strong>Step 2 is taken without conditions</strong> to<br>\n<strong>Step 2 is taken with conditions (1)</strong>. Then change the default condition to: <strong>email is not defined (2)</strong>:</p>\n<p>Now that you have set this condition, your virtual assistant will only ask the end user for their<br>\nemail address if the virtual assistant does <em>not</em> already know it.</p>\n<p>Add a new step - <strong>Step 3</strong>. As shown below, in <strong>Assistant says (1)</strong>, write: “What is your first<br>\nname?” Set <strong>Define customer response</strong> to <strong>Free text (2)</strong>. Again, you only want to ask the end<br>\nuser for their name if you don't already know their first name. Change<br>\n<strong>Step 3 is taken without conditions (3)</strong> to <strong>Step 3 is taken with conditions</strong>. Then change the condition to:<br>\n<strong>firstname is not defined</strong>. Step 3 should look like this:</p>\n<p>Next, add Step 4. In this step, set <strong>Assistant says: (1)</strong> to “Please describe your problem or<br>\nsituation in detail. This description will be submitted to the support team as the ticket.” Then,<br>\n<strong>Define customer response (2)</strong> as “Free text:”</p>\n<p>Create Step 5, and set <strong>Assistant says (1)</strong> to: “Creating your ticket…” Change <strong>And then (2)</strong><br>\nfrom “Continue to next step” to “Use an extension:”</p>\n<p>In the ensuing popup, select “Zendesk Ticketing” under <strong>Extension (1)</strong> and “Create Ticket” under<br>\n<strong>Operation (2)</strong>. Open the dropdown (3) menu where you set <strong>request.subject</strong> to something, scroll<br>\nall the way down to the bottom, and select <strong>Expression (4)</strong>:</p>\n<p>Choosing <strong>Expression</strong> now lets you type in free text <strong>(1)</strong>. Type in “Support ticket,” as shown in<br>\nthe image below. Then, open the <strong>Optional parameters (2)</strong>, and set <strong>request.comment.body</strong> to<br>\nthe response to <strong>Step 4 (3)</strong>. Set <strong>request.requester.name</strong> to the <strong>firstname (4)</strong> session variable.<br>\nFinally, set <strong>request.requester.email</strong> to the <strong>email (5)</strong> session variable, and click <strong>Apply (6)</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: Take care not to accidentally set <strong>request.requester.name</strong> to the response to <strong>Step 3</strong>, and<br>\nnot to set <strong>request.requester.email</strong> to the response to <strong>Step 2</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your Action should now look like this:</p>\n<p>There is one more thing you need to do.</p>\n<p>In Step 5, you pass the session variables <strong>firstname</strong> and <strong>email</strong> to the extension. These session<br>\nvariables are where you stored the firstname and email information from HubSpot.</p>\n<p>However, if the end user tries to submit a support ticket with this Action when the virtual assistant<br>\nhas not pulled in their information from the HubSpot CRM system, then those session variables<br>\nwill be blank (also known as “undefined” or “not defined”). And while steps two and three in this<br>\nAction ask for the email and firstname when those session variables are blank (or “undefined” /<br>\n“not defined”), you're not using that information when you call the extension.</p>\n<p>We need to make sure your virtual assistant uses the responses to step two and three when the<br>\nemail and firstname session variables are not defined. To do this, add Step 6, and<br>\n<strong>drag and drop the new step between steps three and four</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Step 6</strong> now becomes <strong>Step 4</strong>. In it,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Set a condition, which will check whether both first name and email are defined.</li>\n<li>Set the first condition to <strong>3. What is your first name?</strong> is defined.</li>\n<li>Set the second condition to <strong>2. What is your email address? is defined</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After you finish setting up the step condition, click <strong>fx (1)</strong> to open the <strong>Variable values (2)</strong> view,<br>\nand click <strong>Set new value + (3)</strong>:</p>\n<p>Set the Session variable <strong>firstname (1)</strong> to the response to <strong>Step 3</strong> by following the sequence of<br>\nclicks <strong>(2)</strong> and <strong>(3)</strong> shown below:</p>\n<p>Again using the sequence of clicks shown above, also set the Session variable <strong>email</strong> to the response<br>\nto <strong>Step 2</strong>. Your Step 4 should now look like this:</p>\n<p>If you do not see “2. What is your email address” in the list of action variables, this may be a bug.</p>\n<p>Take a moment to consider the behavior you set up in this Action<br>\n<strong>(I want to submit a support ticket)</strong>. When the end user invokes this Action, if the <strong>email</strong> and <strong>firstname</strong> session variables are<br>\n<em>not</em> defined, the virtual assistant asks for this information in Step 2 and Step 3. In Step 4, if the<br>\nvirtual assistant asked for, and received this information in Step 2 and Step 3, you store the<br>\nresponses to Step 2 and Step 3 in their corresponding session variables.</p>\n<p>Now, this information will always be in the session variables, so the extension will always have<br>\nthe correct email and firstname to pass to Zendesk.</p>\n<p>Finally, create a closing step. Position yourself on step 6 so that you add a step at the very end, and<br>\ncreate step 7. As shown below, write <strong>(1)</strong> “Success! Your ticket number is ”. Then, type <strong>$</strong> or click<br>\nthe <strong>insert a variable icon</strong> and scroll down to select the variable for <strong>body.request.id (2)</strong> returned<br>\nby the Zendesk Ticketing extension in Step 6 when it created the new ticket:</p>\n<p>Finish the <strong>Assistant says (1)</strong> section with “. A customer support representative will follow up<br>\nwith you within the next few days.” Change <strong>And then (2)</strong> to “End the action.” Your Step 7<br>\nshould look like this:</p>\n<p>Fantastic work! Our action is ready to go. Remember to save it.</p>\n<p><strong>Preview the action to see your extension in action</strong></p>\n<p>Try out a conversation where you don't pull in information about yourself via HubSpot, like<br>\nshown below. Remember to view it with the <strong>Action variables</strong> visible like you did earlier, so you<br>\ncan watch them populate in real time. Enter the following utterances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Say “I want to submit a support ticket”</li>\n<li>Enter your email address (or any email address)</li>\n<li>Enter your name (or any first name)</li>\n<li>Say “I want to see how this extension works”<br>\n(the screenshot below captures the whose single conversation)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, go and see the ticket you created in your instance of Zendesk! To do so, navigate your<br>\nbrowser to <strong>https://{server-domain}.zendesk.com/agent/dashboard (1)</strong>, and view the ticket<br>\nwith subject 'Support ticket' (2):</p>\n<p>Your ticket should have an ID of #2. Ticket ID #1 is a sample ticket created by Zendesk for you.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: Zendesk also sends two emails, one to the submitter of the ticket, and one to the Zendesk<br>\nadministrator. Depending on what emails you supplied, you may see both of these in your Inbox.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, try out a conversation where you first pull in information via HubSpot and then create a<br>\nsupport ticket via Zendesk. (Remember to first hit <strong>Refresh</strong> to restart the chat session.) In this<br>\nway, you will be taking advantage of both the HubSpot and Zendesk extensions:</p>\n<p>Notice how this time the assistant didn't ask for your first name or email address, since it already<br>\nretrieved them from the HubSpot CRM system.</p>\n<p>Go back to your Zendesk dashboard and see the ticket you just created. (Note that you may need<br>\nto refresh the page.) Once finished, you may now close your Zendesk browser window.</p>","location":"/en/watsonx/assistant/level-4/201#build-a-custom-extension-to-a-ticketing-service","page":"201: Custom Extensions"},"611":{"title":"Debug a custom extension","text":"<p>You've now successfully built and previewed two custom extensions.

Run through the following<br>\nconversation with your assistant in the Preview panel of the Actions page:</p>\n<p>This extension works properly: it uses the member number provided by the end user to pull the<br>\nend user's information from the HubSpot CRM system. Click <strong>Inspect (1)</strong> to open the<br>\n<strong>Extension inspector</strong> and see its details:</p>\n<p>As can be seen above, the <strong>Extension inspector</strong> pane shows the request parameters sent <em>to</em> <strong>(2)</strong><br>\nand response properties received <em>from</em> <strong>(3)</strong> the HubSpot API via the custom extension. While you<br>\nonly store and use a handful of these response properties in your Action – including email,<br>\nfirstname, lastname, and membership_status - there are many more properties passed along that<br>\nprovide useful context.</p>\n<p>In this conversation, something went awry. While there are two error messages that make it clear<br>\nsomething went wrong, you can also see that the virtual assistant said “Welcome, !” <strong>(1)</strong> The<br>\nname that would normally come from the HubSpot CRM system is missing, which suggests<br>\nsomething went wrong. Click <strong>Details (2)</strong> next to “Error in the response,” to reveal a popup of<br>\nruntime errors affecting the Action.</p>\n<p>On the ensuing popup, expand the first error:</p>\n<p>Depending on your ability to parse technical jargon, you may or may not be able to understand<br>\nthese error messages. That's okay - watsonx Assistant's Extension inspector will lay it all out in<br>\neasy-to-understand terms.</p>\n<p>Close the runtime errors pop-up. Now click <strong>Inspect (1)</strong> next to “Extension error.” What do you<br>\nsee? It looks like the body of the response is completely blank <strong>(2)</strong> – and the success response<br>\nproperty is <strong>false (3)</strong>. This means that HubSpot was unable to find a contact with ID 46. You may<br>\nrecall from earlier that your HubSpot CRM system has no Contact with an ID of 46.</p>\n<p>You can also open the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab of the Extension inspector (not shown) to see the request<br>\nand response for this extension in raw form.</p>\n<p>You could fix this end user's problem by adding a Contact record to HubSpot with ID 46. But<br>\nthat's not a scalable solution for others entering a non-existent member number.</p>\n<p>Let's fix this problem in the virtual assistant instead.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click <strong>Authenticate me recognized</strong> in the Preview panel to open the Action.</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>step 3</strong>.</li>\n<li>Add a condition to step three, so select <strong>with conditions</strong>.</li>\n<li>Step 3 should execute when the extension runs successfully, so select <strong>If Ran successfully</strong>.</li>\n<li>Your final condition should state <strong>2 Ran successfully == true</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now you will only greet the end user by name if the extension succeeds in getting their name and<br>\nother information from HubSpot. Let's also add a step that will be taken when the extension fails<br>\nto find the end user's information:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new step 4.</li>\n<li>Include the condition that <strong>2 Ran successfully == false</strong>.</li>\n<li>Set <strong>Assistant says</strong> to “Unfortunately, I was not able to pull in your information. Would you<br>\nlike to try again?”</li>\n<li><strong>Define customer response</strong> as <strong>Confirmation</strong>, which allows the end user to select <em>yes</em> or <em>no</em>:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Next, add a step for when the user selects “yes” in the previous step, so that they can try entering<br>\ntheir Lendyr member number again:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new step 5.</li>\n<li>Add the condition that <strong>4. Unfortunately, I was … is Yes</strong>.</li>\n<li>Change <strong>Assistant says</strong> to “Okay –”</li>\n<li>Change <strong>And then</strong> to Re-ask previous step(s).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Select all the checkboxes, so that your assistant will re-ask all action steps, then click <strong>Apply</strong>:</p>\n<p>Finally, add step 6 for when the users selects “no” in step 4:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click **New step + **.</li>\n<li>Add the condition that <strong>4.

Watson Discovery has read and processed all relevant corporate documents.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The search tool (Watson Discovery) will then search its content and produce search results in response to the question.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The search tool passes these search results back to the virtual assistant in a list.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At this point, watsonx Assistant could display the results back to the user. However, they would not resemble natural speech; they would look more like a set of search results.

It may reorder or disregard some of the search results according to how relevant and useful it thinks the search results are to the question. For example, an LLM might decrease the ranking of a search result if it is from a document not recently updated, indicating the information may be outdated. This capability is often called a <strong>neural re-ranker</strong> and is coming soon to watsonx Assistant’s Conversational Search.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The LLM generates an answer to the question using the information in the search results, and it passes this answer back to watsonx Assistant.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The virtual assistant presents this conversational answer to the end user.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Answer traceability</strong>. In some implementations of RAG, the virtual assistant may show the end user the search results that the LLM used to generate the answer. This allows the end user to trace the answer back to its source and confirm its accuracy. This capability is often called “answer traceability” and is available today in watsonx Assistant’s Conversational Search.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom passage curation</strong>. In some implementations of RAG, the virtual assistant also shows the end-user snippets of the search results that the LLM used to generate the answer. These snippets might be direct quotes or 1-2 sentence summaries of the relevant information in each search result, allowing the end user to understand exactly what the LLM pulled out from the search result to craft its answer.

This might be installing a package, copying a file, or shutting down a service on a remote machine. Each Task represents an idempotent operation (an action that can be repeated multiple times and deliver the same result every time) that aligns the remote managed node to the specified state, ensuring consistency across multiple executions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The process of creating AI-generated code recommendations is as simple as modifying the natural language (plain English) Task descriptions of an action that is to be executed, which always start with <code>- name:</code> and followed by some description of the task to be performed. Ansible Tasks are often preceded with some <code>#</code> comments or documentation — particularly inside the Technical Preview assets. After the natural language description of the automation Task has been set, Generative AI handles the rest.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>On the left sidebar in VS Code, click the <strong>Explorer</strong> icon (as shown in the screenshot below) to open the Explorer view to view your current working directory.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p>From the current working directory in the Explorer, navigate to and open the Ansible Playbook in the following directory: <code>lightspeed-demos-main/playbooks/infra/install_cockpit/demo_install_cockpit.yml</code></p>\n<p>The Playbook code in <code>demo_install_cockpit.yml</code> warrants some explanation before we move on with modifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Line 2</strong> essentially marks the beginning of the Playbook instructions, the purpose of which is to automate the process of installing and configuring <a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/automate-rhel-web-console-deployments-cockpit-and-certificate-rhel-system-roles\">Cockpit</a> for Red Hat Ansible. Cockpit is an interactive server administration interface that provides a graphical overview of statistics and configurations for a system or systems within a network.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lines 3-4</strong> define variables that will remain static throughout the remainder of the Playbook. These variables will be referenced by the AI-generated code suggestions at a later stage. This is a key capability of the offering and one which you will go into much finer details on later.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lines 6-9</strong> are variables which have been commented out and therefore are invisible to the execution of the Ansible script and not examined by WCA for context when generating code recommendations. You will experiment with how removing the <code>#</code> comment blocks impacts the recommendations of task block code. \"Uncommenting\" these lines of code will make them viable for execution and these lines will afterwards be considered as valid Playbook \"context\" for AI code generation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Locate <strong>TASK 1</strong> on <strong>Line 15</strong> of the YAML file, which handles installation of Cockpit for Ansible.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\"># - name: Install cockpit package\n</code></pre>\n<p>Pay attention to the indentation and characters used on <strong>Line 15</strong>, which in sequence from left to right are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>begins with a <code>TAB</code> indentation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a <code>#</code> character to \"comment out\" the line contents</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a whitespace <code>SPACE</code> character</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>- name:</code> which signifies the start of a Task definition</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and finally the natural language description of the Task</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To generate code for the Task using WCA, first <strong>uncomment</strong> <strong>Task 1</strong> on <strong>Line 15</strong> (remove <code>#</code> characters from the start of a line).

Indentations (such as the <code>TAB</code> in this example) denote different hierarchies and code nesting levels within the YAML structure. You can use whitespaces instead of <code>TAB</code> if you prefer, but be sure to keep your indentations consistent: keep using TAB or whitespaces for indenting lines of code, but don't intermix the two.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>Afterwards, Line 15 should look like the following — beginning with a single TAB indentation:\n\n```yaml\n  - name: Install cockpit package\n```\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<p>Now you are ready to begin generating code. Place your cursor at the end of <strong>Line 15</strong> and hit <code>Return</code>.

Making use of FQCNs where possible is a recommended best practice and is a prime example of the many ways in which the offering infuses post-processing capabilities within the AI-generated code produced by WCA.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Additional examples of infusing best-practices into AI-generated code recommendations can be found in the following <strong>Task 2 (Line 25)</strong>. Generate the task code block as you did previously, accept the AI-suggested code as given using <code>TAB</code>, and once again compare your results with the solution below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\"># TASK 2\n- name: Copy cockpit.conf.j2 to /etc/cockpit\n  ansible.builtin.template:\n    src: cockpit.conf.j2\n    dest: /etc/cockpit/cockpit.conf\n    owner: root\n    group: root\n    mode: '0644'\n</code></pre>\n<p>The AI-generated code recommendation will copy <code>cockpit.conf</code> to the target host.</p>\n<p>Take note of the fact that the recommendation included the <code>mode:</code> argument and set the Linux file permissions to <code>0644</code>, neither of which were things explicitly requested in the Task <code>- name</code> description, but are both additions which adhere to best practices around defining Ansible automaton tasks. Setting a file permission to <code>0644</code> specifies read and write permissions for User and Group levels within the Linux operating system, and provides only read permissions to all others.</p>\n<p>These additional recommendations stem from a robust example of setting file permissions for the <code>ansible.builtin.template</code> module, a recommended best practice from the Ansible Galaxy and Red Hat communities that Lightspeed carried into this AI-generated code recommendation as well.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>","location":"/en/watsonx/codeassistant/ansible-lightspeed/102#ai-generated-code-recommendations","page":"102: Generative AI for Code with WCA Lightspeed"},"685":{"title":"Content Source Matching","text":"<p>A powerful capability within WCA is <strong>Content Source Matching</strong> (often referred to as \"code explainability\"), which attempts to match AI-generated code suggestions to the training data and sources that were utilized in generating the suggested Task code.</p>\n<p>These code attribution suggestions are created using a <strong>k-NN</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/topics/knn#:~:text=Next%20steps-,K%2DNearest%20Neighbors%20Algorithm,of%20an%20individual%20data%20point.\">K-Nearest Neighbors</a>) algorithm that examines Ansible Galaxy and training data repositories in search of the nearest related content to the AI-generated code suggestions.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To enable <strong>Content Source Matching</strong> capabilities within WCA, navigate to the main menu bar (very top of your screen) for VS Code and go to <strong>View</strong> > <strong>Open View...</strong> as shown below.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The console along the top of the VS Code interface is now activated and awaiting a prompt.

It comes with a collection of ready-to-use, out-of-the-box skills that range from working with productivity tools to providing deep analytical insights. Users can immediately access and use the built-in skills.  watsonx Orchestrate developers, called ‘builders,’ create the customized skills used by the insurance agents. Builders can create skill flows from a sequence of individual skills. When a skill flow is created, it becomes a new “composite” skill that can be used just like an individual skill.  Skill flows perform tasks composed of multiple steps. For example, the insurance agent used a skill flow that combined Salesforce, a product recommendation engine, and e-mail.  We’ll look at how builders create skill flows by sequencing the first two steps of the upsell task performed by the agent. We’ll combine the Salesforce and recommendation engine skills to build a new composite skill flow that searches Salesforce for target customers and then makes product recommendations for the selected customer. |<br>\n| <strong>Action</strong> 2.1.1 Click the <strong>menu slider</strong> icon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |<br>\n| <strong>Action</strong> 2.1.2 Click <strong>Skills</strong> under the ‘BUILD’ section (these options are only shown to users with builder access).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |<br>\n| <strong>Action</strong> 2.1.3 Click the <strong>Add skills</strong> arrow (1).

Additional skills can be added by watsonx Orchestrate ‘builders’ who can create customized skills and make them available to insurance sellers.  Builders can create new skills using a few different sources:  1. <em>Composite Skill flows</em> : We can build composite skills from a sequence of individual skills, such as the skill flow we just created.  2. <em>Embedded Automations</em> : We can create skills using the built-in automation builder, such as the product recommendation skill used to determine the products to upsell.  3. <em>IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation</em> : We can expose skills using pre-built integrations to automation services running in IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation and IBM RPA.

But first, let's discuss what the configurable parameters do. Open the settings panel by clicking the <strong>Model parameters</strong> icon shown below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This opens a list of parameters than can be updated. All models utilize the same inference parameters. Let's explain the purpose of each.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>a. Greedy</strong> vs. <strong>Sampling Decoding</strong> - This is how the model chooses the tokens for output. The first 4 parameters below (b through e) are only visible when in <strong>Sampling</strong> mode.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In <strong>Greedy</strong> mode, the model selects the highest probability tokens at every step of decoding, and a model is less creative in that mode.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In <strong>Sampling</strong> mode, the model chooses the next token from a pool of the most probable next tokens, so there is more creativity, but also a larger risk that the output may be nonsensical.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>b. Temperature</strong> – a floating point number ranging from 0.0 (which causes the model to operate in the same manner as if Greedy decoding was selected) and 2.00 (which is maximum creativity).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The higher the value of <strong>Temperature</strong>, the more “creative” the model would be.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The default value is typically 0.7 but is set to 0.8 in this case. This means the model is allowed certain creativity.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>c. Top P (nucleus sampling)</strong> - a floating point number ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. At a high level, when generating a completion, a model calculates the probability of the next word based on all the previous words. <strong>Top P</strong> decides whether the model will always pick the most likely outcome, or allow more randomness for the next words. <strong>Top P</strong> sampling chooses from the smallest possible set of \"next\" words whose cumulative probability exceeds the value provided for <strong>Top P</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>d. Top K</strong> - an integer from 1 to 100. Unlike <strong>Top P, Top K</strong> does not look at the probability of the tokens. Instead, the model chooses the next word from the <strong>Top K</strong> most likely tokens for the next piece of output.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Top K</strong> = 3, means the model will choose randomly from the top 3 most likely next words.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The higher the value of <strong>Top K</strong>, the more random the outcome would be.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>e. Random seed</strong> - an integer in the range 1 to 4,294,967,295. In Sampling mode, with everything else remaining the same, updating the Random seed will yeild different outputs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If the Random seed remains the same, you should get back the same results, which is why we leave the value the same for these labs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In short, Random seed is helpful for the replicability of experiements.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>f. Repetition penalty</strong> - a value between 1 and 2 (a setting of 1 allows repetition, and 2 prohibits it). This is used to counteract a model's tendency to repeat the prompt text verbatim or get stuck in a loop in generating the same output.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>g. Stop sequences</strong> - sequences of characters (text, special characters, carriage return, etc) used as a stop indicator by the model. The stop sequence itself will still be included in the model output, but that will be the last piece of output.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>h. Min tokens</strong> - an integer that specifies the minimum number of tokens in the model's output.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>i. Max tokens</strong> - an integer that specifies the maximum number of tokens in the model’s output. Sometimes when the generated output looks incomplete, your Max tokens value may be too low.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Keep in mind, you are charged or limited based on the number of tokens used, so be careful setting the Max tokens higher than necessary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The values you see are the default values for the <strong>Marketing email generation</strong> sample use case. Let's play with the values and see how some changes impact our output. Leave the current prompt in place, and change the value of <strong>Temperature</strong> from <strong>0.8</strong> to <strong>0.4</strong>.</p>\n<p>Click <strong>Generate</strong>. You should now see the following output.</p>\n<p>Notice by lowering the creativity the output changed quite a bit, and we now have a rather lengthy thank you ending.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reset the <strong>Temperature</strong> value to <strong>0.8</strong>, and lower the <strong>Top P</strong> value from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>0.5</strong>. This means the next token will be chosen randomly from the top number of tokens whose collective probability is greater than 0.5. Click <strong>Generate</strong> again.</p>\n<p>You should see very similar output. In this case, lowering the Top P value had roughly the same effect as lowering the Temperature.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Now let's update the <strong>Top K</strong> value to 25 and reset <strong>Top P</strong> to <strong>1.0</strong>.</p>\n<p>Click <strong>Generate</strong>. You should see the following.</p>\n<p>The output has reverted to the original. The model is now choosing the next token from the 25 tokens with the highest probability, so clearly the update to <strong>Top P</strong> resulted in fewer than 25 options for the next token.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Continue lowering the <strong>Top K</strong> value. Notice that if you lower it quite far (to about 10) you should see pretty good output with accurate info.</p>\n<p>Why the difference? This is best illustrated with an example. Consider a model has determined the following set of potential next tokens for a particular input:</p>\n<p>| Token | Probability |<br>\n| ----- | ----------- |<br>\n| T1    | 0.16        |<br>\n| T2    | 0.15        |<br>\n| T3    | 0.14        |<br>\n| T4    | 0.13        |<br>\n| T5    | 0.12        |<br>\n| T6    | 0.11        |<br>\n| T7    | 0.10        |<br>\n| T8    | 0.09        |</p>\n<p>In this case when you set:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Top P = 0.5</strong>, the model chooses randomly among T1, T2, T3, and T4 (because the probabilities sum up to > 0.5).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Top K = 50</strong>, the model chooses randomly among all 8 of the tokens (as 8 &#x3C; 50)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thus, for this case, you need to lower <strong>Top K</strong> to <strong>4</strong> to have a similar effect as <strong>Top P = 0.5</strong> so both settings are choosing among the top 4 tokens.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>","location":"/en/watsonx/watsonxai/102#modifying-parameters","page":"102: Parameter config and output formats"},"762":{"title":"Prompting for different output formats","text":"<p>When prompting an LLM, it's often beneficial to get the output in a specific format.

The next question might be <em>Why use a Vector DB?</em>; to understand that we first need to understand what embeddings are. Human language is very complex, the human brain is capable of understanding when we use words that mean the same thing or understand that certain words belong to a specific group. For example, our brains are able to understand that <em>\"red\"</em> and <em>\"blue\"</em> are both colors despite them being different words, we can also understand that when someone uses the words <em>\"happy\"</em> and <em>\"joyful\"</em> they generally represent the same emotion or feeling depsite them being two very different words. Trying to explain that to a machine is very difficult, but LLM's try to mirror some of this complexity in their own way, through a complex understanding of numbers. In short, an LLM tries to understand human language in a format that makes sense to machines, groups of numbers. Without getting to complicated LLM's use a translator to convert human language into numbers that it can easily associate with, this translator is usually an embedding function, and the output is a vector of numbers known as <em>embeddings</em>. A simple example of this might be the the phrase <em>\"Good morning\"</em> represented as the following <em>[34, 12, 234, 638, 12, ...]</em>.</p>\n<p>While to humans, this might not make any sense, it's meaningful to a machine because these numbers represent a sort of comprehesion for a machine to properly understand human language. These vectors can be plotted on a graph as they can represent coordinates which can be plotted, from these coordinates we can determine how close two embeddings, <em>or two pieces of text</em>, are to one another; this idea of closeness is a core principle behind <em>semantic search</em>, which we use when we want to query or look through all of our stored embeddings for text <em>(or embeddings)</em> similar to our query. Now comes our VectorDB, it stores all of our embeddings <em>(along with associated metadata)</em> and conceptually acts as a plot of all of the vectors that we have stored; when we make a query against our VectorDB it can return the embeddings that are closest <em>(shortest distance)</em> to our query from the plot. A simple visual representation of this can be seen in the image below:</p>","location":"/en/watsonx/watsonxai/107#what-are-embeddings-and-why-use-a-vectordb","page":"107: RAG using VectorDB"},"798":{"title":"What is Chroma DB?","text":"<p>ChromaDB <em>(or Chroma)</em> is marketed as a database for building A.I applications, but at its core can be simplified as a database for storing vectorized data as embeddings. The distinction for embeddings is important because embeddings have emerged to become the A.I-native way to represent any kind of data (i.e. text, video, images), making them ideal for working with all kinds of A.I-powered tools and algorithms. One things that makes Chroma unique from other embeddings database is its lightweight nature allowing it to be run in-memory if there is no need persistence. Being lightweight also lends Chroma to be fast, easily scalable <em>(by supporting other traditional databases for persistence)</em> and easy to use SDKs integration using Python and Javascript.</p>","location":"/en/watsonx/watsonxai/107#what-is-chroma-db","page":"107: RAG using VectorDB"},"799":{"title":"Putting it all together... RAG with VectorDB","text":"<p>Now the we have enough background information, we can put it all together and try to understand from a high-level how the pieces for RAG using Vector DB fit together. As discussed previously, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an approach used to improve the context provided to an LLM (Large Language Model) in generative AI use-cases, including chatbot and general question-answer applications. The vector database is used to enhance the input prompt passed to the LLM by adding additional context to the input query. Instead of passing the prompt directly to the LLM, <em>in this case watsonx.ai</em>, in the RAG approach you follow the steps below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Generate embeddings, which are output as vectors, from an existing dataset that serves as the knowledge base - This dataset, which adds additional context to the LLMs response, can come in the form of product documentation, research data, technical specifications, product catalog and descriptions, and even more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Store the output embeddings from the previous step into a Vectorized database. Vectors are easy to index and can be queried very fast.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a user initiates a prompt, instead of passing it directly to the LLM, we augment it with additional context:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The user prompt is passed into the same embedding model used for our dataset, returning a vector embedding representation of the query.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This embedding is used as the query (semantic search) against the vector database, which returns similar vectors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>These vectors are used to look up the content they relate to (if not embedded directly alongside the vectors as metadata).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This content is provided as context alongside the original user prompt, providing additional context to the LLM and allowing it to return an answer that is likely to be far more contextual than the standalone prompt.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With all those pieces together you can complete a RAG use-case using Vector DB however, there other ways to complete RAG.</p>","location":"/en/watsonx/watsonxai/107#putting-it-all-together...-rag-with-vectordb","page":"107: RAG using VectorDB"},"800":{"title":"Comparing with Watson Discovery","text":"<p>In the <a href=\"/watsonx/watsonxai/106\">previous lab</a> we completed a RAG use-case using Watson Discovery; in this lab we make use of a Vector database instead. While both fo these techniques can be used to achieve the same thing, they differ in their approach. Watson Discovery is primarily used as a document understanding and analysis platform, this works out very well in scenarios where large numbers of documents are used or needed to make business decisions. For example, a large corporation sifting through larges amounts of company financial documents to determine insights before making a merger or acquisition; or a law firm sifting through briefings and other law documents to conduct legal research for legal precedents. Vector databases work a bit different by creating embeddings, or arrays of large numbers, from tokens of text which are then stored into a database and can be quickly referenced when a similar embedding query of user input is supplied to the vector database. Both solutions achieve the same results for determining context, however they way they are impletmented is their biggest differentiator. With Watson Discovery, you can make use of a managed service and sleek UI to ingest and even annotate documents for future Natural Language queries; given its managed nature Watson Discovery also proves to be an easier tool to integrate into other servies using a simple API Key, Service URL, and Project ID; however, this simplicity comes at the cost of granular control. Vector databases can used as both as a managed <em>(i.e. PineconeDB)</em> or unmanaged <em>(i.e. ChromaDB)</em> service, unlike Watson Discovery which is only provided as a managed offering. Vector databases also provide more fine tuned controls such as using different embedding models (for vectorization) or tokenizers allowing users to customize the DB to better fit their unique use-case which can be much better approach the general one-size fits all approach of Watson Discovery. This additional controls, does come with added complexity making it harder to easily integrate VectorDB the same way you can with Watson Discovery. Overall both approaches are able to support the RAG model that is becoming popular with LLM's, since you have already completed RAG with Watson Discovery, this lab will explore doing the same with Vector databases.</p>","location":"/en/watsonx/watsonxai/107#comparing-with-watson-discovery","page":"107: RAG using VectorDB"},"801":{"title":"Run the VectorDB + watsonx.ai lab","text":"<p>To run the lab for this section we will start by logging into the watsonx platform; after navigating to the watsonx home page <a href=\"https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/wx/home\">here</a>, we will want to open the Notebook editor that we can use to run the notebook associated with this lab.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you don't know how to acccess watsonx.ai or are unsure how to open to the notebook editor, follow <a href=\"/watsonx/watsonxai/100#how-do-i-import-a-jupyter-notebook-in-watsonxai\">this reference link</a> which will walk you through the process for accessing watsonx.ai and opening the Jupyter notebook editor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Use the following values for this lab:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Name:</strong> <code>{uniqueid}-rag-chromadb</code></li>\n<li><strong>Notebook URL:</strong> <code>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-build-lab/VAD-VAR-Workshop/main/content/Watsonx/WatsonxAI/files/rag-with-chromadb.ipynb</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>After your notebook is launched and created, you can follow along and run through each cell of the notebook to complete the lab.

A user sends requests ( <em>prompts</em> ) to a model, and the model generates a response. To an end user generative AI may look like a chatbot or a search engine, but implementation of generative AI is different from legacy chatbots that rely on hardcoded business rules and search engines that use indexing.</p>\n<p>Unlike traditional machine learning models, which always require training, LLMs are pretrained on a very large dataset. There are dozens of LLMs, which are developed by different companies. Some companies contribute their models to open source, and many of them are available on the LLM community site <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/\"><em>Hugging Face</em></a>. It’s up to the LLM developer to publish information about the model and the dataset that the model has been trained on. For example, see the <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xxl\">model card</a> for one of the popular open source models, <em>Flan-T5-xxl</em>. In general, all LLMs are trained on publicly available data. IBM is one of the few companies that publishes detailed information about the data that was used to train the model. This information can be found in <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/X9W4O6BM\">Research Papers</a> published by IBM.</p>\n<p>You can think of the data that the model has been trained on as its “knowledge”. For example, if the model was not trained on a dataset that contained <em>2022 Soccer World Cup</em> results, it will not be able to generate valid/correct answers related to this event. Of course, this applies to all business use cases in which we need models to interact with proprietary enterprise data. We will explain how to solve this problem later in the lab.</p>\n<p>Two more factors influence LLM capabilities: size and instruction-tuning. Larger models have been trained on more data and have more parameters. In the context of LLMs, the number of parameters refers to the number of adjustable weights in the neural network that the model uses to generate responses. Parameters are the internal variables of the model that are learned during the training process and represent the knowledge the model has acquired.</p>\n<p>While it may seem obvious that a larger model will produce better results, in a production implementation we may need to consider smaller models that meet our use case requirements because of the hosting and inferencing cost.</p>\n<p>Instruction-tuned models are models that have been specifically trained for tasks such as classification or summarization.

Usually models that have gone through <em>fine-tuning</em>, <em>instruction-tuning</em> , and <em>RLHF</em> generate significantly better output.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Fine-tuning</em> means that the original LLM was trained with high quality labeled data for specific use cases. For example, if our goal for the model was to “Act as an IT architect” when generating output, during the fine-tuning process we provided labeled data examples of a writing style for IT architecture.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the model goes through the instruction-tuning process, then it will be able to generate output without explicit instructions, such as <em>“Can you answer this question?”</em> The model will understand that you’re asking a question from the context and sentence structure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>RLHF</em> ( <em>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback</em> ) is a technique that’s used to improve model output based on feedback provided by testers, usually domain experts (for example, lawyers for generation of legal documents). Before the model is released, it’s updated based on testing results.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While all vendors can say that their model has been fine-tuned, instruction-tuned, and has gone through RLHF, the industry benchmarks for LLMs are not mature. Even benchmarks that may eventually become the industry standard (for example, <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/truthful_qa\">TruthfulQA</a>) test only certain aspects of model output.</p>\n<p>A potential solution to this issue is the research done by the broader LLM community. The LLM community is very active; information about the quality of models usually becomes widely known through various community resources such as articles, blogs, and YouTube videos. This is especially true for open source vs. proprietary models. For example, search for “llama vs. ChatGPT” and review results. You can also review the <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard\">leaderboard</a> on Hugging Face, keeping in mind that you will need to understand the evaluation criteria used for the leaderboard (see the <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard\">About</a> page of the leaderboard).</p>\n<p>Currently, the <em>llama-70b-2-chat</em> model is one of the best models for zero-shot prompting.<br>\nWhile it may seem like an obvious choice to always use <em>llama-70b-2-chat</em> in watsonx.ai, it<br>\nmay not be possible for several reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Model availability in the data center (due to resources or licensing)</li>\n<li>Inference cost</li>\n<li>Hosting cost (for on-premises or hybrid cloud deployments).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It may be possible to achieve similar results with other models or with smaller versions of<br>\n<em>llama</em> by using few-shot prompting or fine-tuning, that’s why it’s important to experiment<br>\nwith multiple models and understand prompt/turning techniques.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: Instructions in this lab are written for the flan and llama models, which are available<br>\nin all IBM Cloud data centers where watsonx.ai is hosted and in the on-premises version of<br>\nwatsonx.ai. We encourage you to try other models (for example, granite and mpt-7b), if<br>\nthey’re available in your workshop environment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After the <strong>Prompt Lab</strong> UI opens, switch to the <strong>Freeform (1)</strong> tab. Select the <strong><em>flan-ul2-20b</em> (2)</strong> model.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: We will review model settings later in the lab.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since most LLMs, including the selected flan model were trained on publicly available data, we can ask it some general questions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Type in the question: <code>What is the capital of the United States?</code> and click <strong>Generate</strong>. The generated answer is highlighted in blue.</p>\n<p>We got the answer to our question without instructing the model to do it because the flan model was instruction-tuned to answer questions. Google , the creator of this model, published the training instructions that were used for the model in this <a href=\"https://github.com/google-research/FLAN/blob/main/flan/v2/flan_templates_branched.py\">git repository</a>. As you can see in documentation, the instructions are often shown in a “technical format”, but they are still helpful for understanding the best prompting options for this model.</p>\n<p>Scroll down to the <em>natural questions</em> section of the git page. Here we can see the various phrases we can use with the model when asking questions.</p>\n<p>Next, we will ask a different question: <code>When was Washington, DC founded?</code></p>\n<p>Double check if this is a correct answer by doing a traditional Internet search. You will find out that the correct answer is <em>July 16th, 1790</em>.</p>\n<p>Next, switch the model to <em>granite</em> , then <em>llama2-70b-chat</em> and ask the question again. This time we get the correct answer.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>Next, switch the model to <em>mpt</em> and ask the question again - we get another incorrect answer.</p>\n<p>In general, this was not a simple question because at the time of writing conflicting dates are listed on the <em>Library of Congress</em> website and <em>Wikipedia</em>. <em>Library of Congress</em> is a more credible source, and in this example the <em>Wikipedia</em> page, which may have been used for model training, has the incorrect date.</p>\n<p>We provided this example to highlight the fact that the primary usage of LLMs should not be <em>general knowledge question and answer</em>. The quality of LLM output depends on the knowledge base that it was trained on. If we asked another question, it’s possible that <em>flan</em><br>\nwould outperform other models.</p>\n<p><strong><em>We should think of LLMs as an “engine” that can work with unstructured data rather than a “knowledge base”.</em></strong></p>\n<p>When you first start working with LLMs, you may think that some models are not returning the correct response because of the prompt format. Let’s test this theory with the <em>flan</em> model.</p>\n<p>Enter this prompt in the <strong>Prompt Lab</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\">Answer the question provided in '''.\n\nQuestion: '''When was Washington, DC founded?'''\n\nAnswer:\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let’s review why we constructed the prompt in this format:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Triple single quotes (‘’’) are often used to identify a question or text that we want the LLM to use. You can choose other characters, but avoid “ (double quotes) because they may already be in the provided text</li>\n<li>Notice that we provided the word “ <em>Answer</em> :” at the end. Remember that LLMs <em>generate the next probable word</em> ”, and providing the word “Answer” is a “hint” for the model.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, we did not get a more accurate result from the <em>flan</em> model.</p>\n<p>We will try one more approach, this time with a different prompt, which you can copy below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">Using the following paragraph, answer the question provided in '''. \n\nParagraph: \n\nWashington, D.C. was founded on July 16, 1790. Washington, D.C. is a unique and historical place among American cities because it was completely planned for the national capital and needed to be distinct from the states. President George Washington chose the specific site (e) along the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers. \n\nThe Serial Set contains a lot of information about the plan for the city of Washington, including maps, bills, and illustrations. In this Story Map, you can see original plans and pictures of Washington, D.C.\n\nQuestion: '''When was Washington, DC founded?''' \n\nAnswer:\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>While this example may seem simple because we provide the answer in our prompt, it demonstrates one of the key use cases for LLMs, which is called <em>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)</em>. With RAG, we ask LLMs to answer questions or generate content based on the information that we provide. In our example we hardcoded content in the prompt, but it’s also possible to implement RAG with automatic information retrieval from various knowledge bases, such as Websites, documents, emails, etc. In this case, the main feature of an LLM that we are interested in is “understanding” and not “knowledge”.</p>\n<p>We used a simple example to ask a trivia question, but think about topics that may be relevant to your business for which “general information” may also exist, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are the steps to get a driver’s license?</li>\n<li>What are the steps for submitting a car insurance claim?</li>\n<li>How can I close a credit card?</li>\n<li>How can I improve my credit score?</li>\n<li>Will an airline reimburse me for a canceled flight?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most LLMs will be able to answer these questions because they were trained on data available on the Internet, but if you want the correct answer to your question, in most cases you will need to use <em>RAG</em> , i.e. provide information from your company’s data sources.</p>\n<p><em>Watsonx.ai is supports several implementations of RAG</em>. We will cover it in more detail in one of the other labs.</p>\n<p>Next, we’ll test prompts that generate output.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click on model parameters icon in the top right corner. Use the flan  model for your first test.</p>\n<p>If you would like to learn more about each input in the Model parameters panel, you can review <a href=\"https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/fm-model-parameters.html?context=wx&#x26;audience=wdp\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>Change the <strong>Max tokens</strong> to <strong>500</strong>. When LLMs process instructions and generate output, they convert words to tokens (a sequence of characters). While there isn’t a static ratio for letter to token conversion, we can use 10 words = 15 to 20 tokens as a rule of thumb for conversion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Change the prompt to write a paragraph:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\">Write a paragraph about the capital of the United States.\n\nParagraph:\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that our output is rather brief.</p>\n<p>Next, we will try different model parameters and models to see if we can get better results.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the model settings switch <strong>Decoding</strong> from <em>Greedy</em> to <em>Sampling</em>.

Notice that every time you click <strong>Generate</strong> (after deleting the generated text), you get different results.

With its blend of historic landmarks and modern marvels, London captures the essence of a global metropolis. The River Thames meanders through its heart, bordered by a panorama of architectural wonders such as the Tower Bridge, the Houses of Parliament, and the Tower of London. The city's rich history is palpable in its cobbled streets, where ancient stories whisper from every corner. Museums like the British Museum and the Tate Modern house an unparalleled collection of art and artifacts, while West End theaters stage world-class performances that define the realm of entertainment. From the royal grandeur of Buckingham Palace to the bustling vibrancy of Camden Market, London's diverse neighborhoods offer a mosaic of experiences that celebrate both tradition and innovation. A melting pot of cultures and cuisines, London's culinary scene is a reflection of its global population, inviting exploration and gastronomic delight. In every alleyway, park, and bustling street, London emanates an aura of ceaseless energy and opportunity, inviting visitors and residents alike to immerse themselves in its ever-evolving story.\n\nCapital: '''Tokyo'''\n\nParagraph: Tokyo, the electrifying capital of Japan, stands as a testament to the harmonious blend of ancient traditions and cutting-edge modernity. This sprawling metropolis pulses with a vibrant energy that encapsulates both the past and the future. Skyscrapers and neon lights adorn the skyline, creating a mesmerizing spectacle in districts like Shinjuku and Shibuya. Amidst the urban buzz, historic shrines and temples such as Meiji Shrine and Senso-ji offer serene respites, where one can glimpse into Japan's rich spiritual heritage. The efficient and intricate public transportation system whisks residents and visitors seamlessly across the city's diverse neighborhoods, each with its unique character. From the fashion-forward streets of Harajuku to the upscale elegance of Ginza, Tokyo's districts cater to every taste and preference. Culinary adventures abound, with world-renowned sushi, ramen, and street food stalls enticing the palate. The city's constant evolution is matched only by its unwavering commitment to preserving its cultural heritage, resulting in a truly immersive experience where tradition and innovation dance in harmony.\n\n\nCapital: '''Cairo'''\n\nParagraph: Cairo, the bustling capital of Egypt, stands as a bridge between the ancient wonders of the past and the vibrant pulse of the present. Nestled along the banks of the Nile River, Cairo is a sprawling metropolis that embodies the nation's rich history and contemporary dynamism. The iconic pyramids of Giza and the enigmatic Sphinx loom just beyond the city's edge, bearing witness to the enduring legacy of the Pharaohs. In the heart of Cairo, the historic district of Islamic Cairo boasts intricate mosques, bustling bazaars, and winding alleys that transport visitors back in time. The Egyptian Museum, a treasure trove of antiquities, showcases the remarkable artifacts of ancient civilizations. Amidst the chaos of traffic and markets, the serene calm of the Nile promenade offers a respite, where felucca boats glide by against the backdrop of the city's skyline. Cairo's vibrant street life, aromatic street food, and vibrant arts scene reflect the city's diverse culture and modern ambitions. In the ebb and flow of Cairo's daily life, the past and present converge, creating a city that is as layered and complex as the history it holds within its streets.\n\nCapital: ''' Washington, DC'''\n\nParagraph: \n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Modify model parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Change <em>decoding</em> to <em>sampling</em> (for more creative output)</li>\n<li>Change the min and max number of tokens to the output you would like to see (for example, <em>50 min</em> and <em>500 max</em> )</li>\n<li>If you wish, you can test different models.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Test the model and review the output.</p>\n<p>Next, we will review the concept of tokens.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Notice the token count that’s shown on the bottom of the model output.</p>\n<p>In this screenshot of the <em>flan</em> model output, the “ <em>out of</em> ” number ( <em>4096</em>  ) shows the<br>\nmaximum number of tokens that can be processed by a model.

My house is unique and he did not use the unique pictures to compare value. He purposely left them out of the appraisal. 2) I started my loan process on a Thursday. On Saturday I tried to contact my loan officer to tell him of the American Express offer that I wanted to apply for. I was informed that it was too late and I could not use it because it would delay the process. I had just received the email about the offer and I had just started the process so how was it too late to get in on the $2,000 credit on my current bill. I let it go but I should have dropped the process and restarted it because that would have helped me out with my bill.'''\n\nTop bullet points:\n1. The appraisal company undervalued the reviewer's house by purposely excluding unique pictures that would have accurately assessed its value.\n2. The uniqueness of the house was not taken into consideration, and the appraiser relied solely on comps that did not reflect its true worth.\n3. The reviewer attempted to inform their loan officer about an American Express offer they wanted to apply for, which would have provided a $2,000 credit on their current bill.\n4. The loan officer stated it was too late to take advantage of the offer as it would delay the process, despite the reviewer having just received the email and recently started the loan process.\n5. The reviewer regrets not dropping the process and restarting it to benefit from the offer, as it would have helped them with their bill.\n\n\nReview:'''\nFor the most part my experience was very quick and very easy. I did however, have 3 issues.\n\n#1 - When I received my final numbers, my costs were over $2000 more than was quoted to me over the phone. This was straightened out quickly and matched what I was quoted.\n\n#2 - The appraiser had to change his schedule and when I didn't know if I could be home for the appraisal, he said he could do it with me not there. I do not think this is a wise thing to do or to offer.\n\n#3 - When I received my appraisal, it was far lower than it should have been. My house appraised for basically the same price I purchased it for 14 years ago. I have kept the home up with flooring, paint, etc. It has new shingles on it from last summer, the driveway has been paved, I have about three acres landscaped compared to maybe one when I bought it, and have paved the driveway which was originally gravel.\n\nEven if you discount the insanely high prices that houses are selling for in today's market, the house has increased in value over the past fourteen years. In fact, some of the compared properties looked like camps that were not on water, had no basement or possibly no slab, and very minimal acreage. These comparably priced houses were in no way equal to my 4 bedroom cape, with a wraparound deck, on 4 acres, though not on the water, it is overlooking lake around 100 feet away at the most. I feel very strongly that the appraisal price was put in at a high enough estimate to satisfy the needs of the refinance loan.'''\n\nTop bullet points:\n1. Overall, the experience was quick and easy, but there were three specific issues.\n2. Initially, the quoted costs over the phone did not match the final numbers, resulting in a discrepancy of over $2000. However, this was promptly resolved.\n3. The appraiser offered to conduct the appraisal without the homeowner present, which the reviewer felt was unwise and not recommended.\n4. The appraisal value of the house was significantly lower than expected, even considering the current high housing market prices. The reviewer mentioned various upgrades and improvements made to the house over the past 14 years.\n5. The reviewer expressed a strong belief that the appraisal was deliberately set at a lower value to meet the requirements of the refinance loan, despite the property's unique features and advantages compared to the comparables used.\n\n\nReview:'''\nI was told upfront and throughout most of the process that I would be able to get a $25K payout/cash back based on the market value of my house that was discussed in the original conversation with the loan officer. However, midway into the process I was told by the loan officer that I was only able to get $17.5K back. Additionally, I was told that I would be able to skip 2 months of mortgage payment to help makeup for the cash shortage. However, at the end of the day I was told that I could only skip 1 mortgage payment. These 2 drawbacks caused me to not fully satisfy the financial reason of why I originally wanted to refinance which was to get the $25K cash.\n\nTop bullet points:\n1. The initial agreement with the loan officer stated that the reviewer would receive a $25K cash payout based on the market value of their house.\n2. Midway through the process, the loan officer informed the reviewer that they would only be eligible for a $17.5K cash payout, which was lower than initially discussed.\n3. The reviewer was also promised the ability to skip two months of mortgage payments to compensate for the cash shortage, but they were later informed that they could only skip one payment.\n4. These discrepancies in the cash payout amount and the reduced mortgage payment relief prevented the reviewer from fulfilling their original financial objective of obtaining the $25K cash.\n5. The limitations and changes in the terms impacted the overall satisfaction with the refinancing process and compromised the financial benefits the reviewer had anticipated.\n\nReview:'''\nI started my loan process toward securing a VA loan. I was waiting for a a month and a couple weeks, then I was told that the VA needed to acquire my retirement points to verify my veteran status. If I knew this is what my loan was on hold for, I could have contacted the VA office right away and got this cleared up. \nFor whatever reason, it took the underwriting department a long time to verify my employment status, even after I uploaded a couple years of my W2 forms from both of my jobs, and they had my Social Security number to further verify my employment status. My loan completion date was extended, because I wasn't made aware that they were waiting for my VA status to be approved. The push back for my mortgage is common for mortgage companies, but this caused my interest rate to go up. Then, the securing of a closing lawyer being made aware to me and the lawyer needing three days to get their end prepared for me to go to their office to sign the paperwork wasn't made aware to me. My loan missed the second closing date. For whatever reason, the locked in interest rate jumped up 5/8 points. After making the banker I was working with aware of this, he didn't understand why the locked in interest rate jumped up either. He was nice enough to work on it and was able to get the interest rate down in 1/4 of a point, so my mortgage has an interest rate that is 3/8 of a point higher than my locked in interest rate in the beginning of this process. Although my interest rate is higher than the locked in interest point, at the end, the mortgage is successfully finished.\n'''\n\nTop bullet points:\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use either the <em>flan</em> or the <em>mpt</em> model</li>\n<li>Keep the decoding method as <em>Greedy</em></li>\n<li>Add a stop sequence of “.” to prevent output that ends with mid-sentence.</li>\n<li>Make sure to set the min and max tokens to 50 and 300.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After testing the prompt, click <strong>Generate (1)</strong> and then click on the <strong>View code (2)</strong> icon.</p>\n<p>Copy the code to a notepad.</p>\n<p>Let’s review the code.</p>\n<p>This code is an example of a REST call to invoke the model. <strong>Watsonx.ai</strong> also provides a<br>\nPython API for model invocation, which we will review later in this lab.</p>\n<p>The header of the REST request includes the URL where the model is hosted and a<br>\nplaceholder for the authentication token.

If you keep adding prompts and responses to memory, you can quickly run out of tokens.</li>\n<li>Cost of tokens if you're using a hosted instance of LLMs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>LangChain</em> provides several types of memory to help mitigate these issues, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>ConversationBufferWindowMemory</em>: keeps a list of the interactions in the conversation over time. It only uses the last K interactions.</li>\n<li><em>ConversationSummaryBufferMemory</em>: keeps a summary of interactions, using token length rather than an arbitrary number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions.</li>\n<li><em>ConversationTokenBufferMemory</em>: keeps a buffer of recent interactions in memory, and uses token length rather than the number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the time of writing, the WML API supports integration with the most basic memory type, that being <em>ConversationBufferMemory</em>, which keeps the entire conversation in memory until the memory fills or until it's explicitly cleared. According to <em>LangChain</em> documentation, it uses the \"first in, first out\" approach to remove information from the buffer.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Log in to <strong>watsonx.ai</strong> and navigate to your project.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create a notebook from a URL:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select <strong>New Task -> Work with data and models in Python and R notebooks</strong></li>\n<li>From the left-hand nav select <strong>URL</strong> as the source for the notebook</li>\n<li>Keep the default runtime environment <em>(Python 3.10 XS)</em></li>\n<li>Given the notebook a unique name like <code>[your_name]_langchain_memory</code></li>\n<li>Enter an optional description for your notebook</li>\n<li>Use <code>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-build-lab/VAD-VAR-Workshop/main/content/Watsonx/WatsonxAI/files/203/LangChain_Memory.ipynb</code> for the <strong>Notebook URL</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let's review the notebook code.</p>\n<p>After installing the required libraries, we create a model object similar to the way we created it in the previous example.</p>\n<p>We recommend that you try both the <em>flan</em> and <em>llama</em> models in this notebook (uncomment the model that you would like to run and re-run the cell).</p>\n<p>We use the standard <em>LangChain</em> API to create the memory buffer object.</p>\n<p>After that, we construct our prompts, and in our code, we expect the 2nd cal to the LLM to analyze the output from the 1st prompt.</p>\n<p>Notice that we provide 2 examples of <em>user_input</em> for the first prompt.

Many use cases require working with proprietary company data, and it's one of the reasons why RAG is frequently used in generative AI applications. RAG also allows us to add some guardrails to the generated output and reduce hallucination.</p>\n<p>RAG can be implemented for various AI use cases, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Question and answer</li>\n<li>Summarization</li>\n<li>Content generation</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A \"human interaction\" analogy of RAG is providing a document to a person and asking them to answer a question based on the information contained within.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>RAG is \"an application pattern\" that can be implemented with multiple technologies. However, there are two key steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>During the <strong>retrieval</strong> step, we searched through a knowledge base (documents, websites, databases, etc.) to find information relevant to the instructions sent to the model. Retrieval can be based on keyword search or more advanced algorithms, like semantic similarity.</li>\n<li>The <strong>generation</strong> step is similar to the generation in non-RAG use cases. The main difference is that information retrieved in the first step is provided as \"context\" (included in the prompt). Prompting the model to rely on \"retrieved context\" only, in contrast to the general knowledge which was used to train the LLM, is the key step for preventing hallucinations.</li>\n</ul>","location":"/en/watsonx/watsonxai/level-4/204#rag-overview","page":"204: Implement RAG Use Cases"},"845":{"title":"Vector databases","text":"<p>The \"knowledge base\" for the retrieval step is typically implemented as a <strong>vector database</strong>. Vector databases are not new, they have been used for several years for semantic search.</p>\n<p>Semantic search is a search technique that aims to understand the intent and context of a user's query. It's more advanced than traditional keyword-based search, which relies on matching specific keywords.</p>\n<p>Some popular vector databases are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chroma (open-source)</li>\n<li>Milvus</li>\n<li>Elasticsearch</li>\n<li>SingleStore</li>\n<li>Pinecone</li>\n<li>Redis</li>\n<li>Postgres</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some vector databases, like _Chroma, are in-memory databases, which makes it a good choice for experimenting and prototyping RAG use cases. In-memory databases do not need to be installed or configured. This is because all of their data is stored in volatile memory for the duration of the program's runtime. The downside of this though is that we will need to load the data each time we run the application.</p>\n<p>Vector databases store unstructured data in a numeric format. For AI use cases, we use a specific term to describe the converted unstructured data - <strong><em>embeddings</em></strong>. Embeddings are created by using an embedding model, for example, a popular open-source model <em>word2vec</em>_.</p>\n<p>One of the key features of embeddings is the ability to preserve relationships. With embeddings, words can be \"added and subtracted\" like vectors in math. One of the most famous examples that demonstrate this is the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\">king - man + woman = queen\n</code></pre>\n<p>In other words, adding the vectors associated with the words <em>king</em> and <em>woman</em> while subtracting <em>man</em> is equal to the vector associated with the word <em>queen</em>. This example describes a gender relationship.</p>\n<p>Another example might be:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\">Paris - France + Poland = Warsaw\n</code></pre>\n<p>The vector difference between <em>Paris</em> and <em>France</em> here captures the concept of a capital city.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of a semantic search for the word \"education\". Notice the \"nearest point\" words in the table. The measurement is in numbers because the search was performed using vector (numeric) data.</p>\n<p>You can experiment further with this <a href=\"https://projector.tensorflow.org/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Based on what we have discussed so far, we can make the following conclusions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We have a choice of <em>vector databases</em> for implementations of RAG use cases</li>\n<li>We have a choice of several <em>embedding models</em> for converting unstructured data to vectors</li>\n<li>Retrieval of relevant information is the first step in the RAG pattern, and the quality may be affected by the choice of a vector database and an embedding model.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the mentioned factors, loading data into the vector database requires <strong><em>\"chunking</em>\"</strong>, which is the process of dividing text into sections that are loaded into the database. There is no single guideline for defining chunks because the best size depends on the content we're working with.</p>\n<p>For generative AI use cases, we typically start with _fixed-size chunks, which should be \"semantically meaninguful\". For example, if in your document each paragraph has approximately 200 words, convert the number of words to several tokens (may vary per LLM), and use this number as the starting chunk size. In addition to the size of the chunk, we also need to specify overlapping (the same information in more than one chunk).</p>\n<p>Model providers should publish information on recommended chunk size and overlap percentage for specific use cases. However, even if this information is published, developers will still need to experiment to find the optimal chunk size. If you can't find information on the recommended overlap, you can start with 10 percent (specified in the format of \"number of tokens\", for example, <em>100</em> if your chunk size <em>1000</em>).</p>\n<p>To summarize, we should follow these steps when implementing the RAG use case:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select a vector database. When working with watsonx.ai, we should confirm that the selected vector database is supported. <a href=\"https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/fm-rag.html?context=wx&#x26;audience=wdp\">Check IBM documentation for the latest updates</a>.</li>\n<li>Select the embedding model. Confirm that the embedding model works with the selected vector database.</li>\n<li>Experiment with chunk size.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As we discussed earlier, the second part of the RAG use case, sending instructions to LLM, is similar to non-RAG patterns. Developers should pay special attention to token limits because retrieved content will be added to the prompt. If the token limit is exceeded on input, then the model will not be able to generate output. This check will need to be implemented as \"custom code\" in your LLM applications.</p>\n<p>WML API does return errors if token size is exceeded.</p>","location":"/en/watsonx/watsonxai/level-4/204#vector-databases","page":"204: Implement RAG Use Cases"},"846":{"title":"RAG on documents with LangChain and ChromaDB","text":"<p>To run the lab for this section we will start by logging into the watsonx platform; after navigating to the watsonx home page <a href=\"https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/wx/home\">here</a>, we will want to open the Notebook editor that we can use to run the notebook associated with this lab.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you don't know how to acccess watsonx.ai or are unsure how to open to the notebook editor, follow <a href=\"/watsonx/watsonxai/100#how-do-i-import-a-jupyter-notebook-in-watsonxai\">this reference link</a> which will walk you through the process for accessing watsonx.ai and opening the Jupyter notebook editor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Use the following values for this lab:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Name:</strong> <code>{uniqueid}-rag-chromadb</code></li>\n<li><strong>Notebook URL:</strong> <code>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-build-lab/VAD-VAR-Workshop/main/content/Watsonx/WatsonxAI/files/204/use_case_rag.ipynb</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>After your notebook is launched and created, you can follow along and run through each cell of the notebook to complete the lab.

Such routing tasks need to be automated without spending a large number of human resources. Generative AI is also better at handling incoming complaints in natural language.</p>\n<p>However, there are complexities with this use case. Large Language Models (LLMs) are very good at classifying with single labels (such as positive vs. negative sentiments) but will have a tougher time with business categories which may have very different meanings than the training data for the LLM.</p>\n<p>In this case, sometimes the business requires multiple output labels, and there is specific business logic for why a particular output label is used. Prompt engineering, as you will discover, will have a tough time properly classifying all complaints.</p>\n<p>In prompt tuning, instead of human-generated hard prompts, a user provides a set of labeled data to tune the model. For this example, you will provide a list of sample complaints and the associated departments to be notified. Watsonx.ai will tune the model using this data and create a soft prompt . This does not change any of the existing model weights. Instead, when a user enters a prompt, it is augmented by the soft prompt and is passed to the model to generate output.</p>\n<p><strong>Important note:</strong> Not all models are available for prompt tuning right away.

Its knowledge comes from the data used to train it. The larger the data set, the more the LLM 'knows'. An LLM calculates the output based on the input prompt and the LLM's knowledge base. The more the LLM 'knows', the more options (or the larger the repertoire) the model can draw on for the completion.</p>\n<p>By contrast, if the LLM does NOT know about a subject, it has nothing to draw on. The LLM might try to extract context from the prompt, or it might make things up (hallucinate), or in rare cases, the LLM might not provide a completion.</p>\n<p>For example, if a model's training data does not include any information on automobiles, it cannot generate a sensible paragraph describing what a McLaren is, or the difference between a Ford 150 and a Ram 1500.</p>\n<p>A more obvious example is a language one. Most LLMs can provide a fairly good completion with the prompt: 'Write a paragraph describing Canada'. However, unless the model has been exposed to other languages it would not know how to respond to the same question in another language (even if you simply replace the country name of Canada with its equivalent in another language).</p>\n<p>The classification task you started looking at is another example of this LLM issue.

The range is between 1 and 16 (the default). Generally, the smaller the training data set (in this case the number of entries in the Call center complaints.jsonl file), the lower the Batch size can be.</p>\n<p>However, keep in mind that if the batch size is too small compared to the number of samples in the labeled data set, the longer (and more costly) the tuning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Number of epochs — The number of times to cycle through the training data set. The range is between 1 and 50 (20 is the default). The higher the number, the longer it takes to complete the tuning. There are a couple of factors in play:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A higher number of epochs means it is more costly (you are using more resources).</li>\n<li>A higher number of epochs usually means the model is improving in prediction. However, there is a levelling effect where further recycling of the training data will not bring meaningful improvement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Learning rate - This determines how fast the neural network will progress towards the optimal learn state (when prediction is closest to reality). If the rate is too low, the model is likely to pick up a lot more nuances but will take a very long time to get to the optimal state. If the rate is too fast, the model may miss the actual optimal point. The range is between 0.01 to 0.5 (0.3 is the default). See [Appendix A] for more details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Accumulate steps — This is the number of training steps (or batches) you want to accumulate before updating the internal parameters of the model. The range is between 1 and 128 (16 is the default).</p>\n<p>For example, if Batch size is 10 and Accumulate steps is 10, then watsonx.ai will process 10 examples from the labeled data set each time, and after 10 such batches, the internal parameters will be updated.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A detailed explanation of these parameters is out of the scope of this guide.

This is only prompt tuning and not fine-tuning (where you are changing the actual model). Fine-tuning will take much longer.</p>\n<ol start=\"21\">\n<li>The tuning process completes, and you will see the Loss function plotted.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: At a high level, the Loss function measures the difference between what the LLM predicts and what is the actual result. There are several things to observe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When tuning began, the value of the Loss function value was high. The LLM s completion is quite different from the expected output.</li>\n<li>As expected, with every re-training (epoch), the Loss function's value came down as the model became better at predicting.</li>\n<li>You see the levelling effect started around epoch 18. The model is no longer gaining a lot more knowledge via additional epochs. So, while a higher Number of epochs means a more accurate model in general, you can very quickly reach a point of diminishing return. Remember that the more epochs you run, the more costly it is.</li>\n<li>The Loss function levels off around 0.7. This likely means that the data set can be improved.

Learning Rate","text":"<p>This is not meant to be a thorough discourse of Learning Rate, but sufficient information to understand why you may need to tune the Learning Rate parameter when you are performing prompt tuning.</p>\n<p>As seen in Step 21, part of prompt tuning is the calculation of the Loss function. At a simple level, the Loss function measures how well the LLM models your dataset. The closer the LLM s completion is to the actual desired output, the smaller the Loss. So, in prompt tuning, you want to find the lowest point of the Loss function. Ideally, one would like to see it reach zero — but that is difficult (impossible almost).</p>\n<p>This is where Number of epochs and Learning rate come in. The Number of epochs is how many times to cycle through the training data. While in general the more epochs the better, there will be a point of diminishing return where the cost of another epoch brings no further improvement.</p>\n<p>Here is the graph of the Loss function from Step 21:</p>\n<p>In this function, the lowest value seems to be around 0.75. The distance between each dot can be thought of as the Learning rate.</p>\n<p>If the Learning rate value is too low, then even after 20 epochs the Loss function might have only reached a value of 1 (see the 20 red arrows below). This means that the LLM is not close to providing the best completion for the test data.</p>\n<p>One might be tempted to use a large Learning rate. This may not be a bad idea if the Loss function is shaped as above — and ever dipping line. A larger Learning rate may get to the lowest point sooner (or as low as the Number of epochs allows).</p>\n<p>However, a high Learning rate means you are allowing the model algorithm to accept large changes. You can overshoot the lowest point of the Loss function. For example. If the actual Loss function looks like the black curve below.</p>\n<p>The red arrows reflect a large Learning rate, so it progresses quickly. However, because of the large steps it completely missed the lowest point of the Loss function. This means that the algorithm change to the LLM will not be optimal, even though it may be not bad .</p>\n<p>The natural question arises of how to set the Learning rate. Here is a suggestion:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start with the default value.</li>\n<li>If the Loss function is levelling off early (as in the example in Section 6.2), try a smaller Learning rate to see if there might be hidden valleys.</li>\n<li>If the Loss function is still showing continued decline after 20 epochs, try a larger Learning rate or a higher Number of epochs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Always keep in mind — the Loss function is calculated based on the data you put in. So, while you might get to a levelling off at a low value, it just means the LLM is now able to perform generations reflective of the labeled data set. It does NOT necessarily mean it is optimally tuned to your entire data set. Simply think of the Loss function using Call center complaints v2.jsonl. It too would have been leveling off. However, it certainly does not perform as well as the model trained on Call center complaints.jsonl.</p>","location":"/en/watsonx/watsonxai/level-4/206#appendix-a.-learning-rate","page":"206: Prompt Tuning"},"891":{"title":"207: Generate synthetic data","text":"<p>In this lab, you will be introduced to the following watsonx.ai capabilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New foundation models available since the publication of the original watsonx.ai<br>\nTechnical Sales Lab Guide Part 1.</li>\n<li>Generating synthetic data for use with traditional AI or foundation models<br>\ntesting/tuning.

Just imagine you're a hacker. Which model would you choose to target for prompt injection hacking?

TPC-H is a decision support benchmark maintained by the Transaction Processing Council (TPC). It is intended to mimic a real-world business workload involving a number of ad-hoc queries running while concurrent modifications are made to the data. The dataset that supports this benchmark includes information on customers, suppliers, orders, part numbers, and more.

This time travel capability is useful in a number of different ways. For example, having the ability to query historical data is useful for auditing purposes. Or if an application corrupts table data in some way, you can imagine the value in being able to quickly reverse those changes by resetting the table to a known good state.</p>\n<p>Iceberg uses snapshots to support this time travel capability. A snapshot represents the state of a table at some point in time. When data is modified in a table, such as inserting, updating, or deleting records, a new snapshot is created. There are maintenance operations that can be used to clean up older snapshots that are no longer needed.</p>\n<p>As of 3Q 2023, time travel queries are not yet supported in watsonx.data.

Watsonx.governance ensures model transparency. If AI isn't your goal, Watsonx.ai and governance may not be necessary. \n\nWatsonx complements IBM CP4D and can be used with it. Watsonx.data is also available as a cartridge to enhance CP4D’s data sources, enabling data mesh.\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>If your data analytics currently rely solely on Db2 Warehouse, watsonx.data won't offer any immediate benefits. However, if you anticipate expanding your data sources in the future, especially with a mix of on-premises and cloud data, watsonx.data becomes valuable.\n\nIt enables seamless integration of diverse data sources in the hybrid cloud, allowing you to add public cloud test data and optimize query costs efficiently. \n\nUnlike Db2 Warehouse's single query engine, watsonx.data ensures cost-effective compute resources, crucial for budget management in a cloud environment where performance needs vary.\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>Data sources like Db2 Warehouse and OEM databases (MongoDB, SingleStore, EDB, etc) in IBM CP4D use separate query engines with distinct SQL dialects, requiring users to learn different query syntax.\n\nSwitching between databases is the only way to optimize compute resources, but it necessitates changing the query syntax. \n\nIBM watsonx.data offers a unified SQL syntax for all queries accessing Apache Iceberg tables, even if these tables are distributed across various locations in the hybrid cloud.

The best data is data that is fully understood and trusted and just because you can access the data doesn’t mean that it’s prepared for AI use cases.</p>\n<p>To satisfy the project team's request to meet their analytical goals, you will use the <strong>Data governance</strong> capabilities of IBM's data fabric solution, <strong>Cloud Pak for Data</strong>, that are provided by <strong>Watson Knowledge Catalog</strong>, to ensure the data needed is easily found and accessible from a trusted source, that the data content is of the highest quality, and can be fully understood, and that any confidential, personal or sensitive information is governed and protected with no risk of being exposed to those who do not have the authority to access or view it.</p>\n<p>To accomplish this, you will perform the following tasks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Define and publish the following governance artifacts to the Business Glossary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Categories</li>\n<li>Classifications</li>\n<li>Data Classes</li>\n<li>Business Terms</li>\n<li>Reference Data</li>\n<li>Policies</li>\n<li>Data Governance Rules</li>\n<li>Data Protection Rules</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Data classes and business terms can be leveraged and assigned during the metadata enrichment process as data assets are automatically profiled, so data consumers can get a better understanding of the data content and business context.</p>\n<p>There are two types of rules: <strong>Data governance</strong> and <strong>Data protection</strong>. Data governance rules are only descriptive and are <strong>not</strong> enforceable, must be assigned to a category, and can be imported using a CSV file. Data protection rules are enforceable and actionable, are not assigned to a category, cannot be imported, and reside outside of the governance artifact category hierarchy. Data protection rules autonomously enforce data privacy actions, without any human intervention, to eliminate the risk of confidential, personal, and sensitive information being exposed to those who are not authorized to access or view it.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p>Discover and import the data assets needed using the automated <strong>Metadata Import</strong> process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enrich the metadata of the data assets needed using the <strong>Metadata Enrichment</strong> processes to automatically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Profile data content</li>\n<li>Access data quality</li>\n<li>Assign data classifications</li>\n<li>Assign business terms</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Publish the data assets to a governed catalog.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Augment and socialize the cataloged data assets.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>","location":"/en/wkc/101#introduction","page":"101: Introduction and Prerequisites"},"1134":{"title":"Prerequisites","text":"","location":"/en/wkc/101#prerequisites","page":"101: Introduction and Prerequisites"},"1135":{"title":"1.
