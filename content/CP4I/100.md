# 100: Environment Setup 

The environment for labs 101 and 102 is not yet accessible to business partners and must be facilitated as part of an IBM workshop. Labs 103 (the L3 badge lab) and 104 are facilitated with a TechZone environment that is available for IBM business partners, but an IBM workshop may still utilize a shared environment. 

## Cloud Pak for Integration Platform Navigator

The Cloud Pak for Integration Platform Navigator is a web-based application that allows you to access all the components in CP4I. For shared environments, your instructor will provider you with a URL for the CP4I Platform Navigator and login credentials. You will need this link to access all the CP4I components that you will use in the labs. We recommend that you keep it open in a separate tab.

To log in to the Platform Navigator do the following:

1.  Navigate to the URL provided to you by your instructor for the Platform Navigator.

2.  Select the **Enterprise LDAP** user repository, enter your username and password and click on **Log in**

1. Navigate to the URL provided for the OpenShift console.
