# Data Observability with Databand

This workshop shows how to configure and perform common data observability tasks on an IBM DataStage flow using Databand

This workshop will teach IBMers and Business Partners about the additional monitoring and alerting capabilities that Databand brings to DataStage on Cloud Pak for Data as a Service (CP4DaaS). The DataStage flow we will be observing is found in the Data Integration tutorial. This flow combines anonymized mortgage applications data with the mortgage applicantsâ€™ personally identifiable information to help lenders decide whether they should approve or deny mortgage applications.

## Prerequisites

This lab uses the `lite` (otherwise known as free) plans for Cloud Pak for Data as a Service on IBM cloud and is best accessed with a personal account.
