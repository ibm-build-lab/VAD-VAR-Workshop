# 104: Catalog the Data

The data curation process is complete and you are now ready to create the governed catalog and publish the fully enriched data assets to the catalog so they are ready for use by the analytics project team to accomplish their data and AI analytical objectives.

## 1. Create the Catalog

This section creates the **governed** catalog that you will use to publish the fully enriched data assets that you just curated. This catalog will be named the **Business** catalog, so make sure you do not have a catalog in your environment, that you created and own, by the same name.

1. Select the **Navigation** menu (the 4 stacked horizontal lines in the upper left corner).

4. Copy the text below and paste it into the **Name** field:

<CopyText text="Business"/>

5. Copy the text below and paste it into the **Description** field:

<CopyText text="This catalog stores governed assets used by the business for analytical and AI projects."/>
    
6. Using the **Object storage instance** dropdown, select a Cloud Object Storage instance in your environment where you want to create the catalog.

7. Select the checkbox next to **Enforce data policies**.

14. Select the **Business Catalog Enrichment** project.

## 2. Publish Connections

In this section, you will publish the connections, one at a time, and in the order listed in the instructions below, to the governed **Business** catalog before you publish any data assets. This will place them at the end of the **Recently added** category list in the catalog, leaving room for the data assets to appear front and center, in order of importance, so they are easily found and viewable.

1. Select the **X** in the top right corner of the information panel to close it.
2. From the **Assets types** section on the left, select **Data access > Connections**.

13. Click the **Publish** button.

## 3. Publish Data Assets

In this section, you will publish the data assets to the **Business** catalog. As you did with the connections, the data assets are published in a specific order, so that the **Recently Added** category in the catalog gets populated properly. You will publish the **WAREHOUSE\_SHIFTS**, **WAREHOUSE\_STAFF**, and **WAREHOUSE\_STAFFING** data assets together, in one publication step, and then publish the **EMPLOYEE** data asset last.

1. Uncheck the checkbox next to the **Data Warehouse** connection.

2. From the **Assets types** section on the left, select **Data > Data assets**.

14. Select the **Business** catalog as the **Target** catalog (It should be selected by default).

15. Click the **Publish** button.

You have successfully published the connections and data assets to the **Business** catalog, and are finished working from the project. This project is very valuable, and reusable, and the data curation process is repeatable. You can modify the metadata imports to add or remove assets, and modify the metadata enrichment process to improve the business term, and data class assignment accuracy, and learn from the results. You can also make changes upstream, to the business glossary governance artifacts, to improve the data curation accuracy, rerun metadata enrichment, review the results, and re-publish existing assets, or publish new assets, to the governed catalog. Which is why you were instructed to change the **Duplicate asset handling** option to **Update original assets** when you created the catalog.
