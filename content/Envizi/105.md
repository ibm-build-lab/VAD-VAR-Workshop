# 105: Connectors 

There are several ways to capture data in Envizi.
- UI: is an option for entering smaller amounts of data in a one-off manner.  
- Bulk loading from a template

### Current Process
- Custom, per source system, per customer
- Highly specific
- Match the incoming data file based on name, format, headings, etc.
- Uses an S3 cloud storage bucket as the landing zone for files that should be consumed by the connector
- Scalability is lacking with this approach

### Coming Soon - End of Q2
Universal account connector - will require a standard template which varies by account style.

A data loading template (Account Style Extract Report can be downloaded from the UI for any Account Style). This will allow partners much more flexibility in how they want to get data into Envizi.

#### Option A
Source files are transformed by external systems or processes to match Envizi’s universal file format (varies by Account Style) and loaded directly via the Universal Account Connector.

#### Option B
Source files are transformed by a managed service using instances of App Connect to match Envizi’s universal file format (varies by Account Style) and loaded via the Universal Account Connector.
- App Connect transformation flows and monitoring services delivered by IBM Integration Services
- Set pricing based on number of data types in source file
- Custom integrations priced on request e.g. API interfaces
