Along with the dashboards that were explored before, Turbonomic provides a dedicated planning tool to help Infrastructure Managers decide infrastructure changes.

You can see there are multiple plan types available, for on-premises infrastructure, for Kubernetes clusters as well as for Public Clouds. 

Let’s see an example plan for optimizing the infrastructure.

1. Click on **NEW PLAN**
2. Select **Optimize On-prem**

## Dashboard 

A custom dashboard is a view that you create to focus on specific aspects of your environment. You can create dashboards that are private to your user account, or dashboards that are visible to any user who logs into your Turbonomic deployment.

1. To create a custom dashboard, Click on **Dashboards** from the left navigation
