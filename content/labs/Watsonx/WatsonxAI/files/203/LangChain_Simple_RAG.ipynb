Many use cases require working with proprietary company data, and it's one of the reasons why RAG is frequently used in generative AI applications.\n","\n","There is more than one way to implement the RAG pattern, which we will cover in a later lab. In this notebook, we will use _LangChain's RetrievalQA_ API to demonstrate one implementation of a RAG pattern. In general, RAG can be used for more than just question-and-answer use cases, but as you can tell from the name of the API, _RetrievalQA_ was implemented specifically for question-and-answer. \n","\n","To get started we'll first verify that you have the necessary dependencies installed to run this notebook.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Considerations\n","\n","At current time of writing (October 22th, 2024), **Python 3.13** is not supported for the Pandas package.
