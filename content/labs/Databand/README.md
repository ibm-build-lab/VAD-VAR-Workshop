# Data Observability with Databand

This workshop introduces key Databand capabilities and provides a hands-on exercise to configure and perform common data observability tasks for an IBM DataStage flow using Databand.

The [first lab](/databand/101) provides a scripted walk though of key data observability features and benefits that are provided by Databand. This lab is a good place to see how Databand provides capabilities that help data engineers understand problems in data pipelines earlier, understand impacts of issues and errors, and ultimately remediate problems faster. The flow of this lab follows IBM's recommended way to demonstrate Databand to a potential customer.

The [second](/databand/102) and [third](/databand/103) labs show IBMers and Business Partners the additional monitoring and alerting capabilities that Databand brings to DataStage on Cloud Pak for Data as a Service (CP4DaaS). The DataStage flow we will be observing is found in the Data Integration tutorial. This flow combines anonymized mortgage applications data with the mortgage applicantsâ€™ personally identifiable information to help lenders decide whether they should approve or deny mortgage applications.
