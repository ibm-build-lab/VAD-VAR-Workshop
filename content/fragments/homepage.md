This site contains content for IBM Ecosystem partners (primarily our Value-Added Distributors and Value-Added Resellers) to build experiential sales skills with various IBM products.

These workshops include hands-on labs that give you _"show, not tell"_ experiential selling skills. The content will help you prepare for the [Level 3 Technical Sales badges](https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCGX2M377qBM38TMpQ7DB3WVmQg8) for each technology.

These workshops have been customized from the Technical Sales badge labs in order to fit the time and to add additional "Level 3+"" skills to answer common questions not covered by the base labs nor the Technical Sales quiz.

Currently, the workshops require additional content which introduces them in an in-person workshop setting and provides configuration detail that's not found directly in the repos. This content may be added at a later date.
