## Caveats

Once you provision access to Apptio Cloudability instance, you start receiving daily emails with summary of the cloud spend on the demo accounts. To turn these emails off, follow these steps:

1. Click the **gear** icon in the top-right corner and select **Daily Mail** option from the dropdown.
