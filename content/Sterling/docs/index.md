# Introduction

Welcome to the IBM Sterling Data Exchange Level 3 demonstration workshop! The goal of this guide is to provide IBM and Business Partner technical sellers with the knowledge and tools to perform hands-on demonstrations of IBM Sterling B2B Integrator.

In addition to completing all the steps in this demonstration guide, to obtain the associated IBM Sterling Data Exchange Level 3 badge:

**IBM Technical Sellers** must develop and record a Stand & Deliver presentation. This video is intended to simulate delivery of a “live” demo in front of a client — on camera. IBMers will have flexibility in defining a hypothetical client, the pain points the client has, and the goals they aspire to achieve. The recording will then cover the seller’s hands-on demonstration and pitch to the client the value of the IBM solution using the environment and techniques of this lab. Specific criteria that must be demonstrated as part of the Stand & Deliver recordings is provided within the documentation that accompanies the Level 3 course in Your Learning.

**Business Partners** must pass an accreditation quiz after completing this demonstration guide. The quiz consists of multiple choice questions, with four possible responses (and only one correct answer) for each question. The quiz verifies use of the demonstration environment and not general knowledge of the offering.**Hint: keep the demonstration guide and the associated IBM Technology Zone (TechZone) environment active while completing the quiz.**
