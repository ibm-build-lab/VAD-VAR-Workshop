# IBM watsonx.governance Technical Sales Workshop

IBM watsonx.governance is a core component of watsonx, IBM’s enterprise-ready AI and data platform designed to multiply the impact of AI across an enterprise’s business. 

The IBM watsonx platform is comprised of three powerful components: the watsonx.ai studio for new foundation models, generative AI and machine learning; the watsonx.data fit-for-purpose data store that provides the flexibility of a data lake with the performance of a data warehouse; plus the watsonx.governance toolkit, to enable both generative and predictive AI models throughout their lifecycle that are built with responsibility, transparency, and explainability.

This workshop covers the IBM watsonx.governance L3 badge lab, highlighting some of the core components and capabilities of IBM watsonx.governance. You will take a model through the develop, test, and validate sections of the lifecycle, and see how those changes, the metadata, and metrics collected along the way are reflected in the model's factsheet.

This IBM watsonx.governance hands-on lab introduces you to some of the core components and capabilities of IBM watsonx.governance. By completing this lab, you will gain the experience needed to demo these capabilities to clients.

Specifically, you will get hands-on experience in the following areas for both **predictive** and **generative** AI models:

  - Define an AI model use case
  - Set up an IBM watsonx.ai project
  - Track an AI model
  - Deploy an AI model
  - Evaluate an AI model

After completing these labs in a workshop session, you'll be able to earn the [IBM watsonx.governance Technical Sales Intermediate badge](https://www.credly.com/org/ibm/badge/watsonx-governance-technical-sales-intermediate) based on a quiz about this workshop.
