# Deploy an AI model

### Deploy an AI model

- To learn how to deploy a **generative** AI model, continue to [Deploy a **generative** AI model](#deploy-a-generative-ai-model)
- To learn how to deploy a **predictive** AI model, continue to [Deploy a **predictive** AI model](#deploy-a-predictive-ai-model)

## Deploy a **generative** AI model

In this lab, you will promote a **generative** AI model to a deployment space and deploy it. Watsonx uses deployment spaces to organize models and model-related assets for validation and production access. Deploying the model allows it to be accessed via REST API for further testing.

### Create a deployment space

1. In the IBM watsonx platform, click on the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left to expand it. Locate and click on **Deployments**.

2. Click on the **New deployment space** button.

3. In the **Create a deployment space** window fill out the information below and then press the **Create** button:

  - **Name:** Give your deployment space a name that includes some identifying information, the purpose it will be used for and include "testing" to denote this as a space for testing (ex. `<your initials or unique string> - Claim summary testing`).
  - **Description:** `Test the candidate claim summary model`
  - **Deployment stage:** From the dropdown, click on **Testing** from the list. Designating the deployment stage will ensure that the models deployed in this space will appear in the correct phase of the lifecycle map in the AI use case.
  - **Select storage service:** Ensure that the **Select storage service** dropdown is correctly set to the object storage service you are using for this lab.
  - **Select machine learning service:** Ensure that the **Select machine learning service** dropdown is correctly set to the machine learning service you are using for this lab.

### Create a deployment

The model has been promoted to the space, but cannot be accessed by application developers until it has been deployed. Deployment spaces can contain different types of assets, including the models themselves, as well as data used in batch processing jobs. Spaces are also fully governed, allowing administrators to provide different levels of access for different stakeholders.

1. Click the **New deployment** button.

2. Give your deployed model a name that includes some identifying information and the purpose it will be used for (ex. `<your initials or unique string> - Claim summarization`). Click the **Create** button.
