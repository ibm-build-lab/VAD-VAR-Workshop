# IBM watsonx.ai Technical Sales Workshop

This workshop covers the IBM watsonx.ai L3 badge lab, highlighting some of the core components and capabilities of IBM watsonx.ai with additional L3+ labs that can be included based on client interest.

## Prerequisites and FAQs

Classroom style workshops will typically provide a shared watsonx.ai environment to be utilized for the workshop. However, freely available tech zone and IBM cloud services are available to business partners to facilitate these labs independently.

## Labs

### watsonx.ai Technical Sales Intermediate (L3) badge lab

<details>
  <summary>Things you'll learn</summary>

  - The watsonx.ai web based Prompt Lab UI, including Structured and Freeform interface, sample prompts, model information panels and model parameter panel.
  - Strengths and weaknesses of different models
  - An overview of the model parameters and how they influence output.
  - Zero shot vs. Few shot prompting
  - Using prompts to generate specific output
  - Saving prompts and prompt sessions
  - Restoring a prompt to an earlier state via prompt history
  - Saving prompts to a Jupyter notebook and working with the Jupyter notebook
</details>

<details>
<summary>Disclaimer</summary>

Watsonx.ai is being developed and released in an agile manner, which may result in some of the lab screenshots looking slightly different from what you see in the UI.  You may notice the following differences:

- Additional foundation models in the library list
- Tweaks to the user interface (location of buttons, text/labels for various fields) 
- Additional tabs/buttons (especially when the Tuning Studio is released).

None of the above changes should impact the labs in this document.  However, there are a few possible changes that would compromise the integrity of the lab:

- Ongoing tuning of the foundation models may result in varied results.
- Updates to the sample prompt default text may change. The original text for all prompts has been provided in the lab document if you need to copy/paste to the prompt UI.
