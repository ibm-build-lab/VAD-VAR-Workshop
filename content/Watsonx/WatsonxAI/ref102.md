```

### Rewrite

**Goal**: Transform one of these Markdown passages to HTML

**Markdown passages**
```text
## Background

The [IBM Watson Natural Language Processing library](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/
content/wsj/analyze-data/watson-nlp.html) is a Python library that provides basic natural
language processing (NLP) such as syntax analysis and keyword extraction with out-of-the-box,
pre-trained models. The Watson NLP library also makes it simple to customize the language
models with dictionaries of your domain-specific terms.

```text
[MURAL](https://mural.co) is an online tool that is like a virtual whiteboard: you can draw
shapes, stick notes, and move things around. It’s a fabulous tool for visually organizing ideas,
designing solutions, and collaborating with teammates — in real time or asynchronously.
```


```text
## Function

Using LLMs is pretty easy: prompt the model with text (eg. "I took my dog") and the model
generates text as output (eg. "for a walk").
```


```text
## Hall of shame: when LLMs go wrong

Even the creators of LLMs cannot always fully anticipate or explain these models' output:
[ChatGPT's creators can’t figure out why it won’t talk about Trump](https://www.semafor.com/

### Summarize

**Goal**: Summarize one of these short stories

**Short stories**

```text
A little bird chirped as she gathered twigs and bits of moss in her beak, flitting back and
forth between the trees. With each trip, her nest took shape, becoming cozier and more inviting.
And soon enough, she had created a snug home to raise her brood of chirping chicks.
```


```text
As soon as the package was opened, the little cat's eyes lit up with excitement. She pounced
on the new toy, batting it around the room with joyous abandon. With a contented purr, she
snuggled up with her toy, feeling grateful for the love and attention of her caring owner.
```


```text
The ship heaved and tossed on the angry sea as the storm raged on. Waves as tall as mountains
crashed against the hull, threatening to capsize the vessel. But the captain and crew held
steady, navigating the treacherous waters with skill and determination, until finally, the
storm subsided and the ship emerged triumphant, battered but unbroken.
```


```text
As soon as the two dogs met at the park, their tails began to wag and they bounded around
each other with glee. Their owners struck up a conversation, and soon found that they had
much in common, bonding over their shared love of dogs and the outdoors. By the end of the
day, new friendships had been formed, and both the dogs and their owners left the park with
happy hearts and wagging tails.

```


```text
00:00   [ali]   The goal today is to agree on a design solution.
00:12   [alex]  I think we should consider choice 1.
00:25   [ali]   I agree
00:40   [erin]  Choice 2 has the advantage that it will take less time.
01:03   [alex]  Actually, that's a good point.
01:30   [ali]   So, what should we do?
01:55   [alex]  I'm good with choice 2.
02:20   [erin]  Me too.
02:45   [ali]   Done!
```

00:21   [sam]   Good idea.
00:47   [sam]   Can we go to a movie too?
01:04   [alex]  Maybe golf?
01:15   [sam]   We could give people an option to do one or the other.
01:29   [alex]  I like this plan.  Let's have a party!
```

### Study questions
**Goal**: Create a list of questions a customer might have about one of these topic passages


**Topic passages**

[Creating notebooks](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/creating-notebooks.html)
```
You can add a notebook to your project by using one of these methods: creating a notebook file, 
copying a sample notebook from the Gallery, or adding a notebook from a catalog. You must have 
the Admin or Editor role in the project to create a notebook.
```
<br />

[Using Spark in RStudio](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/rstudio-spark.html)
```
Although the RStudio IDE cannot be started in a Spark with R environment runtime, you can use 
Spark in your R scripts and Shiny apps by accessing Spark kernels programmatically. RStudio uses
the sparklyr package to connect to Spark from R. The sparklyr package includes a dplyr interface
to Spark data frames as well as an R interface to Spark’s distributed machine learning pipelines.
```
<br />

[AutoAI overview](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/autoai-overview.html)
```
The AutoAI graphical tool in Watson Studio analyzes your data and discovers data transformations, 
algorithms, and parameter settings that work best for your predictive modeling problem. AutoAI 
displays the results as model candidate pipelines ranked on a leaderboard for you to choose from.
```

"The little bird spent days gathering twigs, leaves, and feathers, carefully 
crafting her new home. When she finally settled into her cozy nest, she felt a 
sense of pride and contentment, knowing she had created a safe haven for 
herself and her future chicks."

"The little bird tried to carry a twig that was too big for her, and she 
ended up tumbling backward, legs sticking up in the air. Her feathered friends 
tweeted with laughter, and the little bird joined in, knowing that sometimes 
even the best-laid plans can go awry."
```


```text
"The little kitten lapped up the milk with her tiny pink tongue, making a cute 
slurping sound. Her fuzzy face was covered in a white mustache, and she let 
out a tiny purr of contentment as she finished her meal."

"The little kitten nibbled on the treat, savoring every morsel of the delicious 
flavor. Her big round eyes widened with delight, and she purred contentedly, 
grateful for the simple pleasure of a yummy snack."
```


```text
"The puppy spun in circles, trying to catch his tail, but ended up tumbling 
over and over. His antics had his owners laughing out loud, and even the other 
dogs at the park stopped to watch the silly sight."

"The dog chased after the ball, wagging his tail with excitement. His owner 
threw the ball again and again, and the dog happily retrieved it each time, 
barking with joy."
```


```text
"The naughty donkey nudged the gate open with his nose and ran out into the 
meadow, braying with delight. His owner shook his head in amusement, knowing 
that the playful donkey always found a way to bring a smile to his face."

"The mischievous donkey chased after the butterfly, but ended up 
braying in alarm as it flew too close to his face. He stumbled backward and 
tripped over his own hooves, earning a few giggles from the nearby chickens."
```
