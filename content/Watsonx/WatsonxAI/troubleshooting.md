# Troubleshooting Python dependency issues

## Jupyter notebook issues / Python issues

  > **NOTE**: If using Windows, you may have to increase the default length of your PATH variable. Instructions [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/266621/how-to-make-windows-10-accept-file-paths-over-260-characters/)

  > **NOTE**: Some Python dependencies require that you have C++ build tools installed. If your install shows an error similar to `Failed building wheel for chroma-hnswlib`, try the following:
  >  - Windows: Install [C++ build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
  >  - MacOS: Make sure Xcode command line tools are installed `xcode-select --install`
  >  - Linux (debian based): Make sure you have the Python -dev release and build-essentials installed `sudo apt install python3.9-dev build-essential`
