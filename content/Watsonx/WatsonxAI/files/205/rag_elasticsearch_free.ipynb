      "for the 2012 season . The Ravens defeated the 49ers by the score of 34 -- 31 , handing the 49ers their first Super Bowl loss in franchise history . The game was played on February 3 , 2013 , at Mercedes - Benz Superdome in New Orleans , Louisiana . This was the tenth Super Bowl to be played in New Orleans , equaling Miami 's record of ten in an individual city . For the first time in Super Bowl history , the game featured two brothers coaching against each other -- Jim and John Harbaugh , head coaches of the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens , respectively -- earning it the nickname Harbaugh Bowl . In addition , Super Bowl XLVII was the first to feature two teams that had undefeated records in previous Super Bowl games ( Baltimore , 1 -- 0 ; San Francisco , 5 -- 0 ) . The 49ers , who posted a regular - season record of 11 -- 4 -- 1 , entered the game seeking their sixth Super Bowl win in team history ( and first since Super Bowl XXIX at the end of the 1994 season ) , which would have tied the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most by a franchise . The Ravens , who posted a 10 -- 6 regular - season record , made their second Super Bowl appearance in 12 years , having previously won Super Bowl XXXV . Ray Lewis , the\n",

Ottoman massacre of Greek irregulars in Bucharest ( August , 1821 ) In 1862 , after Wallachia and Moldavia were united to form the Principality of Romania , Bucharest became the new nation 's capital city . In 1881 , it became the political centre of the newly proclaimed Kingdom of Romania under King Carol I. During the second half of the 19th century , the city 's population increased dramatically , and a new period of urban development began . During this period , gas lighting , horse - drawn trams , and limited electrification were introduced . The Dâmbovița River was also massively channelled in 1883 , thus putting a stop to previously endemic floods like the 1865 flooding of Bucharest . The Fortifications of Bucharest were built . The extravagant architecture and cosmopolitan high culture of this period won Bucharest the nickname of `` Little Paris '' ( Micul Paris ) of the east , with Calea Victoriei as its Champs - Élysées . I.C. Brătianu Boulevard in the 1930s Between 6 December 1916 and November 1918 , the city was occupied by German forces as a result of the Battle of Bucharest , with the official capital temporarily moved to Iași , in the Moldavia region .

Its architecture is a mix of historical ( neo-classical ) , interbellum ( Bauhaus and art deco ) , communist - era and modern . In the period between the two World Wars , the city 's elegant architecture and the sophistication of its elite earned Bucharest the nickname of `` Little Paris '' ( Micul Paris ) . Although buildings and districts in the historic city centre were heavily damaged or destroyed by war , earthquakes , and above all Nicolae Ceaușescu 's program of systematization , many survived . In recent years , the city has been experiencing an economic and cultural boom . In 2016 , the historical city centre was listed as `` endangered '' by the World Monuments Watch . According to the 2011 census , 1,883,425 inhabitants live within the city limits , a decrease from the 2002 census . Adding the satellite towns around the urban area , the proposed metropolitan area of Bucharest would have a population of 2.27 million people . According to Eurostat , Bucharest has a functional urban area of 2,412,530 residents ( as of 2015 ) . Bucharest is the sixth - largest city in the European Union by population within city limits , after London , Berlin , Madrid , Rome , and Paris . Economically , Bucharest is the most prosperous\n",
