# Lab 105: Building AI apps with Langchain and watsonx.ai

## About

[Langchain](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/) is a framework which helps in developing more complex AI powered apps. It works with many language models, and provides a set of tools to make intricate logic more manageable, such as sending system and human instructions, dynamic prompts using templates, chaining, output parsing, and more.
   - Langchain python module: https://pypi.org/project/langchain/
   - Supports Python and Javascript / Typescript
   - Requires Python 3.8.1 or greater.

Today, we will be using Langchain with [watsonx.ai](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai), and the [IBM Watson Machine Learning SDK](https://ibm.github.io/watson-machine-learning-sdk/), specifically the SDK's [Langchain extension](https://ibm.github.io/watson-machine-learning-sdk/fm_extensions.html#langchain). Langchain already provides support for over 70 LLMs, but in case you want to support a new one, there is also custom LLM functionality. Read more [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/models/llms/custom_llm)

## Prerequisites
1. Make sure Python >= 3.11 is installed. (`python3 --version`)
2. Create a Virtual Environment: `python3 -m venv langchain` Note: you might want to create this in a folder where there aren't any other projects or version control to avoid conflicts.
3. Activate the environment: `source langchain/bin/activate` (If you need to deactivate it later, use `deactivate`)
4. Download [requirements.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-build-lab/VAD-VAR-Workshop/main/content/Watsonx/WatsonxAI/105/requirements.txt) into your folder, and install the requirements: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Download [env-test.ipynb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-build-lab/VAD-VAR-Workshop/main/content/Watsonx/WatsonxAI/105/env-test.ipynb) into your folder, and start Jupyter Notebook with `jupyter notebook`. Run the `env-test.ipynb` to make sure there aren't any errors with your environment or dependencies.
6. Using the [.env.example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-build-lab/VAD-VAR-Workshop/main/content/Watsonx/WatsonxAI/105/.env.example) file, create an `.env` file in your folder.
7. Fill out the values in the `.env` file:
   
   > **NOTE:** If you are attending a workshop, ask your instructors how to acquire these values. Additional instructions on how to find these values are below.
   - `API_KEY` can be found at [cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys) after logging in. (If you don't have access to create an API key, contact your IBM cloud account Admin.)
   - `IBM_CLOUD_URL` should be your regional IBM cloud URL like in `.env.example`
   - `PROJECT_ID` can be found under [watsonx projects](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/projects/?context=wx) under the project manage tab. The id is also part of the URL: `https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/projects/<project-id>/manage/general?context=wx`

##  Labs

For the first part of this lab, we will start with a gentle introduction to some langchain capabilities, including how to initialize a model, change inference parameters, use templates, chains, and load documents. We will then move on to summarization of large amounts of text, which includes more moving parts.

#### Part 1:
Download [langchain-intro.ipynb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-build-lab/VAD-VAR-Workshop/main/content/Watsonx/WatsonxAI/105/langchain-intro.ipynb) to your folder and run `jupyter notebook`, then complete the lab by following the instructions in the notebook.

#### Part 2:
Download [langchain-summarization.ipynb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-build-lab/VAD-VAR-Workshop/main/content/Watsonx/WatsonxAI/105/langchain-summarization.ipynb) to your folder and run `jupyter notebook`, then complete the lab by following the instructions in the notebook.
