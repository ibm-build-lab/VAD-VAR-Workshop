### Accepting the workshop IBM Cloud account invite and accessing the platform

The email used to register for the workshop should be associated with an IBM id. If not, you will need to create the IBM id before you can log in to IBM Cloud and accept the invite.  In addition to the IBM Cloud invite, each workshop participant will be added to a watsonx.ai project with name format: `VEST-Labs-{Location}-{MMDD}` where _Location_ is the location and _MMDD_ indicates the month and day of your workshop.

Follow these steps to accept your IBM Cloud account invite:
