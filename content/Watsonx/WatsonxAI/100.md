### Accepting the workshop IBM Cloud account invite

If you're participating in an IBM workshop, you will be invited to an IBM cloud account a few days before the workshop begins, this will give you access to a shared instance of watsonx.ai that can be used to complete workshop labs. The email used to register for the workshop should be associated with an IBM id. If not, you will need to create the IBM id before you can log in to IBM cloud and accept the invite.  

Follow these steps to accept your IBM Cloud account invite:

1. Log in to IBM Cloud using your IBM id.

2. Navigate to the [notifications panel](https://cloud.ibm.com/notifications) and select the account invite for **EE PoC Account**.
