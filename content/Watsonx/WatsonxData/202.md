# 202: Using IBM Cloud and Amazon S3 Object Storage

## Goal

The goal of this lab is to integrate IBM watsonx.data with Simple Storage Service (S3) API-compatible object storage hosted by IBM Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Object Storage Overview

Object storage is a type of storage architecture where data is managed as objects. Each object typically includes the data itself, a variable amount of metadata, and a globally unique identifier. As implied by the name, the basic unit of object storage is an object, which are organized in buckets (think of a bucket like a high-level directory or folder). Object storage systems allow retention of massive amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, which is well suited for data that is written once and read once or many times. Object storage is low cost, with near unlimited capacity and scalability.

## Prerequisites

### watsonx.data Environment

This lab requires that you already have a provisioned IBM watsonx.data environment. This is done in **[Module 1: Environment Setup](/watsonx/watsonxdata/1)**

### Amazon S3 Object Storage

You must have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to be able to use Amazon S3 storage. Create an AWS account and get started with S3 **[here](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3/)**

> **Note:** As part of the **[AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)**, you can get started with Amazon S3 for free. Upon sign-up, new AWS customers receive 5GB of Amazon S3 storage in the S3 Standard storage class; 20,000 GET Requests; 2,000 PUT, COPY, POST, or LIST Requests; and 100 GB of Data Transfer Out each month.

### IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS)

You must have an IBM Cloud account. If you don’t already have an Object Storage instance provisioned, you must do so. A free “Lite” plan is available that lets you store up to 25 GB of data. Provision an instance of IBM Cloud Object Storage **[here](https://cloud.ibm.com/objectstorage)**.

## IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS)

> **Note:** IBM COS is available in many different worldwide locations. The instructions in this lab guide use us-south (Dallas) regional object storage but you can use a different region that is physically closer to you instead.

### Create COS Buckets

1. Go **[here](https://cloud.ibm.com/objectstorage)** to access your instance(s) of IBM Cloud Object Storage and select the instance you want to work with. This brings 
you to the Cloud Object Storage page for your instance; by default, you’re in the Buckets tab.

**Note: If you’re using an existing COS instance that you’ve used in conjunction with other IBM Cloud services, you’ll see various buckets with seemingly random names. You may explore these buckets if you wish, but do not alter/delete them in any way.**

2. Click the blue **Create bucket** button on the right.

  ![](./images/202/cos-create-bucket.png)

3. Click **Create** at the bottom of the **Create a Custom Bucket** tile.

4. Fill out the following for creating a custom bucket:
  - Enter a unique bucket name. The name must be unique across all IBM COS users, so use `watsonx-data-iceberg-<your initials or unique string>`.

  - Select the **Regional** tile for the Resiliency level.
  
  - Click the **Location** dropdown and select the location where you want your data to be stored; this lab guide uses **United States - Dallas (us-south)**, but you can choose whatever location you want.

  **Note: Remember the resiliency and location you chose. You will need to provide this information later.**

  - Select the Standard tile for the Storage class.

  - Click the blue **Create bucket** button at the bottom of the page. **Do not change** anything else.

  ![](./images/202/cos-create-bucket-settings.png)

  **Note: If you get the Enable Versioning for your Bucket pop-up, click Maybe Later.**

  Once the bucket is created, you will be brought to its administration page in the console.

5. Click your **Object Storage instance name** in the breadcrumbs in the top-left of the screen. This returns you to the main page for your object storage instance. You should be in the *Buckets* tab by default.

6. Repeat steps 2-4 to create another object storage bucket called `watsonx-data-hive-<your initials or unique string>` (remember that bucket names **must** be unique among all IBM COS users). Use the same resiliency and location that you specified for the first bucket.

7. Applications connect to COS through an endpoint URL. The endpoint URL you use in an application depends on the location where the data is stored. Select **Endpoints** from the left-side menu.

  ![](./images/202/cos-endpoints.png)

8. A list of endpoints for all regions are displayed. To filter the list, use the **Select resiliency** and **Select location** dropdown menus, and set them to the same values you used earlier when you created your two COS buckets; for example, **Regional** and **United States - Dallas (us-south)**. The only remaining endpoints you will now see are those associated with your region and location. Copy and paste the URL in the **Public** box to a location you can easily reference later. (To make this easier, there is a **Copy to clipboard** icon to the right of the URL.)

  ![](./images/202/cos-endpoints-filter.png)

### Generate COS Credentials

For security purposes, any external application accessing object storage must provide a valid set of credentials. Specifically, an access key and a secret access key associated with the object storage instance must be provided.

1. While still in the **Endpoints** screen, scroll down to the bottom of the page. In the **Recommended actions** section, click **Get credentials** in the **Get an API key** tile.

  ![](./images/202/cos-endpoints-get-api-key.png)

2. Click the blue **New Credential** button on the right.

  ![](./images/202/cos-new-credential.png)

3. In the **Create Credentials** pop-up window, enter the following information, and then click the **Add** button:

  - **Name:** `watsonx.data-access`
  - **Role:** Manager (this provides the permissions that watsonx.data needs)
  - **Include HMAC Credential:** On

  ![](./images/202/cos-create-credentials.png)

4. Find and expand the twisty for the new credentials you just created. Locate the **access_key_id** and **secret_access_key** fields. Copy and paste the key values for these fields (without the quotes) somewhere for safe keeping. You will need them in the next section.

  ![](./images/202/cos-access-credentials.png)

### Add COS Buckets to watsonx.data

With the two buckets created, they can now be added to watsonx.data.

1. Open the console (user interface) for your **watsonx.data environment** in a new browser window. Keep the IBM Cloud Object Storage console open in another window.

  ![](./images/202/watsonx-ui.png)

2. In the watsonx.data UI, select the **Infrastructure manager** icon on the left-side menu.

  ![](./images/202/infrastructure-manager-icon.png)

3. Click the **Add component** dropdown on the right side and select **Add bucket**.

  ![](./images/202/im-add-bucket.png)

4. In the **Add bucket** pop-up window, enter/select the following information to add the **Iceberg** bucket and then click **Add and activate now**:

  - **Bucket type:** IBM Cloud Object Storage
  - **Region:** Dallas (us-south) (or whatever location you created your bucket in)
  - **Bucket name:** `watsonx-data-iceberg-<your initials or unique string>` (this must match the name of the bucket you created in the previous section)
  - **Display name:** `cos-iceberg-bucket`
  - **Endpoint:** `https://s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud` (or the endpoint you copied earlier; be sure to prefix it with https://)
  - **Access key:** **access_key_id** copied from the credentials you created earlier
  - **Secret key:** **secret_access_key** copied from the credentials you created earlier
  - **Connection status:** Click **Test connection**. If the connection test is successful, **Connection status** will show **Successful**. **Note:** If the test wasn’t successful then you’ll receive an error message as shown below with the reason for the failure. Re-enter all of the fields again and click **Retest** to test the connection again. The most common reasons for an error here are that you mistyped the name of your bucket or pasted one or both of the keys incorrectly.
  - **Activation:** Select **Activate now**
  - **Catalog type:** Apache Iceberg
  - **Catalog name:** `ibmcos_iceberg`

  Your bucket has been added to watsonx.data, but it needs to be associated with the Presto query engine before the bucket can be accessed by it.

5. In the **Catalogs** section, hover your mouse pointer over the **ibmcos_iceberg** tile and the **Manage associations** icon will appear. Click it.

  ![](./images/202/catalog-manage-associations.png)

6. In the **Manage associations** pop-up window, select the checkbox for the **presto-01** engine and then click **Save and restart engine**. A line should now connect the **presto-01** tile in the **Engines** section with the **ibmcos_iceberg** tile in the **Catalogs** section. This connection indicates that the resources are now associated.

7. Repeat steps 3-6 to add the second **Hive** bucket to watsonx.data. Use the following information (differences between the previous instructions are “hive” instead of “iceberg”):

  - **Bucket type:** IBM Cloud Object Storage
  - **Region:** Dallas (us-south) (or whatever location you created your bucket in)
  - **Bucket name:** `watsonx-data-hive-<your initials or unique string>`
  - **Display name:** `cos-hive-bucket`
  - **Endpoint:** `https://s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud` (or the endpoint you copied earlier, be sure to prefix it with https://)
  - **Access key:** **access_key_id** copied from the credentials you created earlier
  - **Secret key:** **secret_access_key** copied from the credentials you created earlier
  - **Connection status:** Click **Test connection**. If the connection test is successful, **Connection status** will show **Successful**.
  - **Activation:** Select **Activate now**
  - **Catalog type:** Apache Hive
  - **Catalog name:** `ibmcos_hive`

### Use COS Buckets in watsonx.data

In this section you will create a schema and table within each of the two catalogs you just added. The data associated with each catalog will reside in its corresponding object storage bucket.

#### Create a New Iceberg table

1. In the watsonx.data UI, select the **Data manager** icon on the left-side menu.

  ![](./images/202/data-manager-icon.png)

  You should see the two new catalogs listed.

  ![](./images/202/new-catalogs.png)

2. Click the **Create** dropdown menu and select **Create schema**.

  ![](./images/202/create-schema.png)

3. In the **Create schema** pop-up window, select **ibmcos_iceberg** for the **Catalog** and enter `sales_schema` for the **Name**. The **Path** field is automatically set based on the schema name, but it can be overridden as needed. However, **do not change** it here. Now click the **Create** button.

4. In the watsonx.data UI, select the **Query workspace** icon on the left-side menu.

  ![](./images/202/query-workspace-icon.png)

5. Clear the SQL editor and copy and paste the following SQL statements into it. Then click the **Run on presto-01** button on the right.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE "ibmcos_iceberg"."sales_schema"."sales" (seller_id INT, year INT, quarter INT, sales_amt DECIMAL (10,2));
  INSERT INTO "ibmcos_iceberg"."sales_schema"."sales" VALUES (1000, 2023, 3, 11435.34);
  INSERT INTO "ibmcos_iceberg"."sales_schema"."sales" VALUES (1000, 2023, 4, 16742.03);
  INSERT INTO "ibmcos_iceberg"."sales_schema"."sales" VALUES (1001, 2023, 3, 8623.78);
  INSERT INTO "ibmcos_iceberg"."sales_schema"."sales" VALUES (1001, 2023, 4, 19912.14);
  ```

6. After the statements in the previous step are finished running, select the **Data manager** icon on the left-side menu.

7. From the left-side navigation menu, select **ibmcos_iceberg** > **sales_schema** > **sales**. This shows the table you just created.

  ![](./images/202/sales-table.png)

8. Switch to the **IBM Cloud Object Storage** console running in the other browser window you were instructed to leave open earlier.

9. Click on the **Instances** dropdown menu in the left-side menu and select your cloud object storage instance. (If you have multiple instances, select the one you used earlier in the lab.)

  ![](./images/202/cos-instance.png)

10. Find and click on the `watsonx-data-iceberg-<your initials or unique string>` bucket you created earlier. (Hint: You may want to use the filter above the bucket list if you have a lot of storage buckets.)

11. Note how there is now a folder called **sales_schema**. Click that folder to drill into it.

  ![](./images/202/sales-schema-folder.png)

12. There is a folder in here called **sales**. This was created when you created the table in the watsonx.data console. The folder name matches the name of the table. Click the **sales** folder.

13. Within this folder are two subfolders that contain the **data** and **metadata** file associated with this Iceberg **sales** table. Feel free to explore these folders.

Congratulations! You have just experienced how you can create Iceberg tables in IBM Cloud Object Storage.

#### Create a Hive Table on Existing Cloud Object Storage Data

In this section you will create a Hive table based on a data file you upload into the Hive cloud object storage bucket you created earlier. You will also see how you can create an Iceberg version of that Hive table.

1. Locally on your computer, create a folder somewhere called **airline_schema** and within it create a subfolder called **aircraft**.

2. Download the **aircraft.parquet** file from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-build-lab/VAD-VAR-Workshop/main/content/Watsonx/WatsonxData/files/aircraft.parquet) and place it into that **aircraft** subfolder on your computer. You should now have an **airline_schema** > **aircraft** > **aircraft.parquet** folder/file structure.

3. In the **IBM Cloud Object Storage** console, click on the **Instances** dropdown menu in the left-side menu and select your cloud object storage instance. (If you have multiple instances, select the one you used earlier in the lab.)

  ![](./images/202/cos-instance.png)

4. Find and select the `watsonx-data-hive-<your initials or unique string>` bucket.

5. This bucket should be empty. Click the blue **Upload** button on the right.

  ![](./images/202/hive-bucket-upload.png)

6. In the **Upload** box that appears on the right, scroll down to the **Upload files (objects)** section and click **Upload folders**.

  ![](./images/202/upload-folders.png)

7. Locate the top-level **airline_schema** folder on your laptop (**not** the aircraft subfolder or the aircraft.parquet file within it) and select that folder for upload from your operating system’s dialog box.

8. Click the blue **Upload** button at the bottom-right to upload the folder you just selected (and its contents) into your object storage bucket. Now close any pop-up messages or notifications indicating the upload was successful.

9. The uploaded folders and file show as **airline_schema/aircraft/aircraft.parquet**. The **/** (forward slash) characters indicate path separators. Click the **Refresh** icon. The interface now shows as proper folders, and if you navigate down into the folders, you’ll find the **aircraft.parquet** file.

![](./images/202/uploaded-files.png)

10. Switch back to the **watsonx.data console** and select the **Data manager** icon on the left-side menu.

11. Click on the **Create** dropdown menu and select **Create schema***.

  ![](./images/202/create-schema.png)

12. In the **Create schema** pop-up window, select **ibmcos_hive** for the **Catalog** and enter `airline_schema` for the **Name** (this matches the name of the upper-level folder you just uploaded). Click the **Create** button.

13. Select the Query workspace icon on the left-side menu.

14. Run the following SQL statement to create the **aircraft** table on top of what was just uploaded. **Replace** the bucket name with the name of the Hive bucket you previously created. The table is made up of all Parquet files in the **airline_schema/aircraft** folder.

```sql
create table ibmcos_hive.airline_schema.aircraft
  (tail_number varchar,
  manufacturer varchar,
  model varchar)
with (format = 'Parquet',
  external_location='s3a://watsonx-data-hive-<your initials or unique string>/airline_schema/aircraft')
```

15. Clear the SQL editor and run the following SQL statement:

  ```sql
  select * from ibmcos_hive.airline_schema.aircraft
  ```

  Note the data returned. This is coming directly from the Parquet file that you uploaded into object storage. Being able to access Hive files directly in watsonx.data is a great way to bring existing data into the watsonx.data lakehouse ecosystem.

16. Clear the SQL editor and run the following SQL statement to create a new schema in the Iceberg catalog. Replace the bucket name in the location string with the name of the Iceberg bucket you previously created.

  ```sql
  create schema ibmcos_iceberg.airline
    with (location = 's3a://watsonx-data-iceberg-<your initials or unique string>/airline/')
  ```

17. Clear the SQL editor and run the following SQL statement to create the new Iceberg version of the table.

  ```sql
  create table ibmcos_iceberg.airline.aircraft
    as select * from ibmcos_hive.airline_schema.aircraft;
  ```

  The result returned from running this statement is the number of rows inserted into the new table – which should be **13,101**.

  > **Note:** If you get an error stating that the airline schema does not exist, wait 10-20 secondsand try the CREATE TABLE statement above again.

Congratulations! You have just experienced how you can create Hive tables on top of existing data in IBM Cloud Object Storage.
