# Relevant open source technologies

**PrestoDB**

- Open Source, distributed SQL query engine, designed for fast analytics queries against data of any size
- Queries on data where it lives using ANSI SQL across federated and diverse sources
- Supports both relational and non-relational sources
- Also supports open source file types (ORC, Parquet, Avro, RCFile, SequenceFile, JSON, Text, CSV)
- Excellent for connecting business intelligence tools to various data sources

- Uses an architecture similar to classic massively parallel processing database management systems
- One coordinator node working in sync with multiple worker nodes
- Query gets submitted to the coordinator which uses prestoâ€™s custom query and execution engine to parse, plan, and schedule a distributed query plan across the worker nodes
- Designed to support standard ANSI SQL semantics, including complex queries, aggregation, joins, left/right joins, subqueries, window functions, distinct counts, and approximate percentiles
