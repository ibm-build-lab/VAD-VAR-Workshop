5. Fill in the Purpose description box with the reason you are making the reservation (e.g. "Workshop lab on watson.data Technical Sales Intermediate Badge organized by IBM Resell Lab"). Then, scroll further down and select your Preferred geography based on your location.(e.g. AMERICAS - us-east region - wdc06 datacenter). Keep the reservation's End date and time(by default it’s two days (48 hours) from now; it can’t exceed two days initially, but you can extend the reservation by two days, up to two times, before it expires). A VPN is needed to access the server, so change the VPN Access dropdown to Enable.

A message in the upper-right corner will briefly appear stating that the reservation has been created. You may also be presented with an opportunity to provide feedback on the process. Feel free to share your feedback.
Shortly after, you will receive an email from IBM Technology Zone acknowledging receipt of the request and you will receive another email when the provisioning is complete. Provisioning may be as quick as 15 minutes, or it may take an hour or more. If provisioning fails, it may be due to a lack of resources in the geography specified. Try again with the same geography or specify a different one.

Reservation status is available at https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations.
