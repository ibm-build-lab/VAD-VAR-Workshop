# Advanced Lab Setup

## Introduction

The QRadar SIEM labs that come after this lab require demo scripts and sample data files that are not included in the virtual QRadar environment used for the previous lab. We need to download a zip file directly to the QRadar server and unpack it.

> If you are using the WireGuard VPN configured in **101: QRadar Demo Setup** to access the demo environment then you can perform the following activities from your workstation. If you have not configured VPN access you can perform the activities from the jump server.

## Download the Zip File

1. Log into the QRadar server:

    ```bash
    ssh root@172.16.60.10
    ```

    The password is: "Q1d3m0".

1. Create a directory for the extended lab data file:
   
    ```bash
    cd /labfiles
    ```
    ```bash
    mkdir extended
    ```
    ```bash
    cd extended
    ```

1. Download the zip file from IBM Cloud Object Storage: 
   
    ```bash
    curl https://s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/jeffa-qradar-siem-labfiles/labfiles.zip -o labfiles.zip
    ```

    > The above command is longer than the text widget, so make sure to use the copy icon to copy the full text.

1. Uncompress the file:
   
    ```bash
    unzip labfiles.zip
    ```

1. This is a big file, so let's remove the zip file to free up some storage space:
   
    ```bash
    rm labfiles.zip
    ```

## Summary
That's it - the script and data files we'll need for the extended labs are now on the QRadar server.

Let's go have some fun...
