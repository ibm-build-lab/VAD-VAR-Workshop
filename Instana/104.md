## Alerting

Instana currently supports 13 technologies for alert channels.

## Adding slack as an alert channel

1. In the Instana dashboard navigate to Settings -> Team Settings tab -> Alert Channels under EVENTS & ALERTS. Click "Add Alert Channel" -> Slack

2. Under "Name" put \<your name\>-slack

3. For webhook URL, you need to add an "Incoming Webhook" app to slack. Use the following url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/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

4. Under "Channel Name" put "alert-lab" and then click Test Channel, and then Create.

## Sending specific events to the channel

Now that the channel has been created, we can proceed to decide which alerts we want to push to slack. For this demo we will push all robot-shop warning issues to the slack channel.

1. In the left hand nav, click Alerts just above Alert Channels, and then "New Alert"

2. For name put \<your name\>-slack

3. Under Events, choose "Alert on Event Type(s)", and then toggle "Warning Issues"

4. Under Scope, choose Application Perspective, and then "Add Application Perspectives". Choose robot-shop. Note: if you are using Instana to observe multiple apps, you can add alerts from multiple different apps at once.

5. Under Alert Channels, select the alert channel you created above, then click Create.

That's it! Now as warnings events are generated from Instana, they will be pushed to the slack channel. This powerful, flexible alerting method allows for need specific alerting, such as using different slack channels for alerts of different severity, or even paging out developers from PagerDuty for critical issues.

## Synthetics

Synthetics are brand new in Instana! They allow for simulated user experiences in your app, and monitoring for various performance characteristics.
Note: Synthetics are only available in a SaaS instance, not on-prem.
