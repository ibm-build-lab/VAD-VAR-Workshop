# Experiential Selling Workshops for IBM Ecosystem Partners (VADs/VARs)

This repo contains content for IBM Ecosystem partners (primarily our Value-Added Distributors and Value-Added Resellers) to build experiential sales skills with various IBM products.

These workshops include hands-on labs that give you "show, not tell" experiential selling skills. The content will help you prepare for the [Level 3 Technical Sales badges](https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCGX2M377qBM38TMpQ7DB3WVmQg8) for each technology.

These workshops have been customized from the Technical Sales badge labs in order to fit the time and to add additional "Level 3+" skills to answer common questions not covered by the base labs nor the Technical Sales quiz.
